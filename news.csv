Due to this internet consumption has gone up drastically given people are either playing games or watching movies or making video calls with friends and family members living far away. People are also depending a lot on OTT platforms for entertainment.Streaming services like Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, and some others have reduced their video quality in order to offer a smooth viewing experience at least during the lockdown period. There are a lot of streaming services available in India and a person who‚Äôs new to OTT platforms might get on about which one to opt for. To make it simple and easy for people to select streaming services and plans that suit them the best we have created a list of all the popular streaming services available in India, and explained how much they cost and the benefits they offer.Netflix is comparatively the most expensive streaming service platform currently available in India. The cheapest plan is priced at Rs 199, however, it only allows you to watch content on your phone or tablet, one screen at a time in SD quality. The Basic plan costs Rs 499, which allows streaming at one screen at a time in SD quality. The Rs 649 Standard plan users are allowed to stream via two screens in HD quality. Lastly, under the Premium plan, which costs Rs 799 offers customers to be logged in to four screens at a time in UHD quality.Hotstar is one of the most subscribed to streaming services in India. The company currently offers customers two types of subscription plans: Hotstar Premium and Hotstar VIP. The VIP plan which allows customers to stream sporting events along with all of Hotstar‚Äôs own content. Then there is the Premium pack, under which the users can stream everything on the platform. The Premium Pack has two sub categories a monthly plan priced at Rs 299 per month and a yearly plan priced at Rs 999 per year.Amazon Prime Video is a streaming service that provides consumers with more than what they get in other streaming services offer. It offers consumers with free music streaming and free delivery benefits. As of now, Amazon only offers a single Prime member subscription with two tiers: monthly, which is priced at Rs 129 and yearly, which is priced at Rs 999.YouTube Premium has its own original shows, but most of them are international shows. Regional premium content is very low, but the content that it has is very engaging. Moreover, Premium customers do not have to watch any sorts of ads and also get access to the YouTube Music service. It is priced at Rs 129 per month and at Rs 399 for three months for single users. Family users who want to add up to five members need to pay Rs 189 per month.

It currently offers four subscription plans to users consisting of Rs 29 a weekly plan, Rs 99 monthly plan, a half-yearly plan at Rs 299 and a yearly plan at Rs 499.Alt Balaji is a service we recommend that you only subscribe to if you are over the age of 18 as it contains a lot of sensitive content. The company offers two packs to choose from, quarterly and yearly, priced at Rs 100 and Rs 300, respectively. It also offers its users multiple free cashback offers with its subscription plans.Many only remember MX Player as a video player that could play the .mkv file format and had a slew of controls. Well, it is not the same now, as it has expanded and provides users with syndicated content along with its own originals. Also, a benefit this has is that it is completely free of cost with users not needing to pay even a single penny. But, due to it being free, the service does show ads in between consuming content.Voot was earlier a free of cost streaming platform, however, the company has recently changed that and is now offering customers premium content at a subscription cost of Rs 99 per month and at Rs 999 per year. However, it has not turned over to a fully paid platform as it still consists of free ad-supported content.üì£ The Indian Express is now on Telegram.

Called the COVID-19 CTI League, for cyber threat intelligence, the group spans more than 40 countries and includes professionals in senior positions at such major companies as Microsoft Corp and Amazon.com Inc.One of four initial managers of the effort, Marc Rogers, said the top priority would be working to combat hacks against medical facilities and other frontline responders to the pandemic. It is already working on hacks of health organizations. Also key is the defence of communication networks and services that have become essential as more people work from home, said Rogers, head of security at the long-running hacking conference Def Con and a vice president at security company Okta Inc.The group is also using its web of contacts in internet infrastructure providers to squash garden-variety phishing attacks and another financial crime that is using the fear of COVID-19 or the desire for information on it to trick regular internet users.‚ÄúI‚Äôve never seen this volume of phishing,‚Äù Rogers said. ‚ÄúI am literally seeing phishing messages in every language known to man.‚ÄùPhishing messages try to induce recipients to enter passwords or other sensitive information on websites controlled by the attackers, who then use the data to take control of bank, email or other accounts. Rogers said the group had already dismantled one campaign that used a software vulnerability to spread malicious software. He declined to provide details, and said that in general the group would be reluctant to reveal what it was fighting.Rogers said law enforcement had been surprisingly welcoming of the collaboration, recognising the vastness of the threat. Rogers is a UK citizen based in the San Francisco Bay Area. Two other group coordinators are American, and one is Israeli.‚ÄúI have never seen this level of cooperation,‚Äù Rogers said. ‚ÄúI hope it continues afterwards, because it‚Äôs a beautiful thing to see.‚Äùüì£ The Indian Express is now on Telegram.

The candidates have been preparing for the exam amidst the 21 days lockdown in their homes taking online classroom sessions and online test series. However, fraudsters are equally active in this period trying very hard to trick the aspirants and steal money.UPSC CSE candidates often receive promotional messages from coaching institutes marketing their preparation material and fraudsters also ride along with similar messages. But this time, cybercriminals are sending alerts to aspirants regarding ‚Äúimportant notification released due to Novel Coronavirus‚Äù with a link. We checked the link and here‚Äôs what we found.The URL takes you to a website where there is no such notification but an advertisement for test series. ‚ÄúDue to COVID-19 all students Please stay home. Our Expert Team Specially Designed Tests and study material. For all UPSC CSE 2020 aspirant [sic].‚ÄùThe website mentions that their test series is designed by ‚Äúprofessor from top university due to COVID-19‚Äù in order to help poor students. Usually, the price of IAS (Prelims + Mains) test series is priced at Rs 40,000 but the website claims to offer the test-series for as little as Rs 699, which is also refundable within 48 hours.The website also claims to offer free Netflix subscription ‚Äúdue to COVID-19‚Äù.With just a simple look at the website and its grammatically incorrect sentences makes it clear that this isn‚Äôt a legit website but is a scam. However, the domain ‚Äúiitmadras.online/upsc.html‚Äù ends up making it look authentic for some users ‚Äî especially to marginalised aspirants who don‚Äôt have enough money to enroll with a test-series program run by reputed coaching institutions. We dug deeper to find the truth of the site.According to who.is, the domain was registered on August 21, 2019 by one Rudra Pratap from Guntur, Andhra Pradesh and expires on August 21, 2020.Once you click on registration link on the web page, it takes you to another website wooe.in ‚Äî a fairly looking site claiming to offer test series for multiple competitive exams at a nominal fee with the promise of a refund. In my investigation, I found that the refund never really happens and the claims are false just to trick aspirants. Following are some screenshots of users who complained about the portal on Quora and consumercomplaints.in:I also discovered that to build its image as a genuine test series provider, Wooe has built a net of positive reviews around the internet including a long list of praises on Quora. Users who posted positive reviews of Wooe.in at Quora also claimed that it is run by IIT Madras.However, IIT Madras has denied its association with any such portal. Following is the notice issued by the IIT Madras:Wooe is not alone in running fake test-series or online coaching programs with prices too real to be true. Somehow, they get a hold of mobile numbers of government job aspirants and send them messages promoting their fake services. Unfortunately, lots of users fall for it and lose money.* If it‚Äôs too good to be true, it‚Äôs probably a scam. There is no way, a private organisation will provide Rs 40,000 worth of test series for Rs 699, that too with free Netflix subscription for a year.* If the message or website in question has grammar mistakes, it is probably fake that has been built in haste for the sole purpose of scamming people.* Look at the URL carefully. Most of these make-shift websites register a domain that gives it an impression of association with a reputed institute‚Äî in this case, IIT Madras. Check for the association. If IIT Madras would have been providing test series, you can find it with a simple Google Search. Also, if you just search IIT Madras, you will get to know that the institute‚Äôs URL is iitm.ac.in and not iitmadras.online.* Don‚Äôt trust random educational portals. Do your research before subscribing to any test-series or online course. In the case of Wooe, it is not easy to identify it based on its website alone but the cheap test-series amount should ring a bell in your head.Express Tech is now on¬†Telegram.

The Galaxy Z Flip too has a flip phone-style form factor but features a foldable glass screen and is cheaper than the Razr.Without getting into comparisons, Mani said both foldable phones have pros and cons. ‚ÄúI think both devices have their own uniqueness in this category,‚Äù he said.Like in the case of the Razr, the phone has a secondary 2.7-inch OLED screen on the outside of the clamshell for notifications when the phone is closed. The Galaxy Z Flip, in contrast, has a tiny 1.1-inch pill-shaped external display that is limited in functionality. The Razr is impressively thin and the hinge that allows the phone to lay completely flat. But where the Galaxy Z Flip scores over the Razr is on the display front and internal hardware. The Galaxy Z Flip is also cheaper in comparison to the Razr.‚ÄúThe design defined Razr for us. In every decision point, the look and feel of the device were kept in mind. So we have succeeded in our view in creating a device that embodies our code philosophy, simplicity, surprise, and richness,‚Äù he explains. Mani said it took the company four years to design the Razr and the team worked closely with Lenovo‚Äôs laptop team to perfect the hinge.Neither the Razr nor the Galaxy Z Flip is perfect, but many critics have found that the Razr is less powerful in terms of specifications. Some even had a harsh opinion on the average camera performance.Mani has defended the company‚Äôs decision to go with the Snapdragon 710 processor and a single 16MP camera on the Razr that costs Rs 124,999. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not just about megapixel or megabytes. It‚Äôs also about what the design bodies, what kind of craftsmanship goes into it, and what kind of material is used. We believe that these are things that make a phone premium today,‚Äù he says. He said that as the price band goes up, the most important thing people consider in a phone is the design language and craftsmanship.Whether a consumer chooses the Razr or the Galaxy Z Flip, both phones have fascinating new technology that‚Äôs largely untested on a large scale, and these phones are expensive to manufacture. Despite the high price of the Razr, Mani believes there is a set of customers who would want to spend the money on a foldable phone. ‚ÄúThe market is big enough for foldable phones,‚Äù he said confidently.¬†The new Razr‚Äôs Rs 124,999 price includes 18 per cent GST, which has increased the cost of the device in India. Fluctuation in the exchange rate and local duties have further added to the retail price of the Razr. The phone has been made in China and not in India, where Motorola manufactures its other smartphones.Mani agrees that the foldable devices are in the early stages and it will take some time to see the growth in the category. ‚ÄúThe foldable itself is at a very nascent phase but we think the category will grow significantly over the next one or two years,‚Äù he said, adding that the company will continue to invest in the foldable tech and work with our partners to develop further functionalities on it.‚ÄùOne big feature the Razr lacks is the 5G connectivity. Although 5G networks are not going to be live in India this year, if you are going to spend Rs 124,999 on a phone, you might expect the feature to be there in the device. However, Mani said the company‚Äôs priority was to get the foldable phone right and 5G was not something Motorola aimed to add in the Razr.Motorola hasn‚Äôt announced a 5G smartphone yet, but the company is looking at this space closely. In fact, both foldables and 5G are important areas for Motorola in the coming years.Mani was tightlipped on the company‚Äôs next foldable phone, but he did say that the team is evaluating multiple designs and form factors. Virtually every smartphone maker is working on foldable smartphones and trying to perfect the technology.The new Razr, which was intended to go on sale from April 2 in India, could be delayed further due to the three-week pan-India lockdown. The country has been put under complete lockdown for 21 days in an aim to curtail the spread of coronavirus in the nation of 1.3 billion people. Flipkart, the exclusive online partner to sell the Razr, has temporarily suspended operations in view of the 21-day lockdown. The phone was also supposed to be available from the top 200 offline stores in India.üì£ The Indian Express is now on Telegram.

This week we have seen competitors Xiaomi and Realme delay the launch of Mi 10 and Nazro 10 series as PM Narendra Modi announced 21-day lockdown in India. In the last month several tech companies have delayed their upcoming launches due to fears over COVID-19. Apple is said to join the list as the company might postpone the launch of its upcoming iPhone.A new report coming from Nikkei suggests that Apple is planning to delay the launch of 2020‚Äôs flagship iPhones. Recently the Cupertino major canceled the WWDC physical event and moved it to online only. WWDC will take place in May this year.Like every year, Apple was expected to launch the new iPhone aka the iPhone 12 series in the fall. Three iPhones were rumoured to arrive this year as well including iPhone 12, iPhone 12 Pro and iPhone 12 Pro Max. But sadly given the situation right now it is highly likely that Apple could delay the launch of the new iPhones.READ: iPhone makers suspend India production due to lockdownSources close to the development of the new iPhones told Nikkei that Apple is worried that people might not be interested to upgrade to the upcoming 5G iPhone amid COVID-19 outbreak. The report further clarified that the launch of the new iPhones could be delayed by ‚Äúmonths‚Äù.No exact timeline has been revealed as yet but some reports suggest that the launch could maximum be delayed by November this year. Apple is yet to confirm any details on the delay. Everything clearly depends on the situation in the coming months.iPhone 12 Pro Max: What is Sensor-shift stabilization and how does it work?Supply chain constraints due to coronavirus could be one of the key reasons behind the delay in Apple keynote this year. Due to COVID-19 Apple has shut all factories as well as stores around the world. Apple manufacturing units in China are closed since last month when the pandemic hit the country majorly and the company couldn‚Äôt risk its worker‚Äôs health.READ: Apple may start reopening stores in first half of April‚ÄúSupply chain constraint aside, Apple is concerned that the current situation would significantly lower consumer appetite to upgrade their phones, which could lead to a tame reception of the first 5G iPhone,‚Äù Nikkei quotes a source close to the development.Apple is yet to talk about the launch delay as yet but given the on-going situation, the delay in iPhone 12 series launch is highly likely.

WhastApp has no official feature that lets you read messages that have been deleted but via third party app called WhatsRemoved+ it is possible for you to read all deleted WhatsApp messages.Oftentimes, mainly while switching to a new smartphone, we lose old WhatsApp texts, media files and that can be very disappointing for some. Today we will discuss a simple way so no one ever loses their WhatsApp chats no matter how old they are.We all know that WhatsApp backs up chats every day. For the unaware, WhatsApp creates a backup of all chats at 2AM in the morning by default unless you have changed the setting manually.ALSO READ: Here‚Äôs how you can read deleted WhatsApp messagesNote: If the daily backup is getting too much you can always change the auto chat backup setting and select the option that best suits your requirement. The options available are: Daily, Monthly, Weekly, and OFF. If you choose OFF option, you will never be able to get access to old chats if switched to a new phone.*¬†You will first need to ensure that the chat backup option of your WhatsApp account is set to Daily. This option makes the process smoother as it keeps a backup of your chats on a regular basis and make it easy to recover it whenever required.*¬†We mostly need to recover deleted WhatsApp messages while switching to a new smartphone or deleting the WhatsApp account.* If switching to a new smartphone you will first need to download the WhatsApp app from Google Play store or Apple App store.* Login to your WhatsApp account by entering the phone number, OTP.ALSO READ: Using WhatsApp to work from home?

https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/gaming/covid-19-video-games-that-you-can-play-at-home-during-the-21-day-lockdown-period-6331387/,Games you can play virtually with friends during the 21-day lockdown,2020-03-26 12:25:20+05:30,"These are stressful times, given the fears over the outbreak of the coronavirus. Plus India is in a 21-day lockdown. One easy and simple way to best some of this stress is to play video games. Studies show that video games also help us improve our response timings and cognitive thinking. Here we will be recommending a few games for you to play during all this free time, with no bar on the gaming product you own.Give most of are now dependent on our mobiles, let us first list out games you can play on the smartphone itself to keep the mind occupied. You can also check out our earlier list on the best games you can play while in self-quarantine.PUBG MobilePUBG Mobile is one of the most popular games across the globe on both iOS and Android. It is also a very easy game to get a hold off. I recommend that you start playing this game, as it has a different mode for every kind of player, like Team Deathmatch, Battle Royale and more. It will also give you the chance to chat with your friends while they play from their homes.Ludo StarIf you want to reminisce about your childhood, when your friends used to come over and all of you would play Ludo, you can download Ludo Star. This game allows you to play Ludo with your friends wherever they are and chat with them via voice or text. You can also play the game with your family members or roommates. You can also connect with random people and make new friends.Asphalt 9: LegendsAsphalt 9: Legends is a pure racing game, that will be able to give you most of the thrill that a real race car would be able to. Asphalt 9: Legends is the best the series has to offer as of now in terms of graphics and controls. Another feature is that they also have a licence from a lot of car companies to use their car names and designs. Thus, providing you with the extra bit of realism.Subscription service (PlayStation 4, Xbox One)My first option would be to get the PlayStation Plus or Xbox Gold service as it will provide you with a number of free games that you can play during this quarantine. It is more fun as you do not know which games will come up the following month, hence helping you grow as a gamer, by pushing you to play different genres of games.The Last of Us (PlayStation 4)Read the name of the game. Yes, that is what it is. Sure coronavirus is not turning people into hideous monsters, but it is no joke.¬† This game will help provide you with a vent as you try and stay alive in a post-apocalyptic Earth where you‚Äôre likely to be killed by other humans. This game might make people anxious about the future, so we recommend that you play this with caution.Resident Evil 7: Biohazard (PlayStation 4, Xbox One, PC)Resident Evil is a series that comes to any gamers mind, when you say the word zombie. And why would it not, it is one of the best zombie games there is, with the right amount of thrill, horror and storyline.Why I chose this version to recommend you is because in this you are trapped in a home, with the Baker family that is very bad at social distancing and is confirmed to be infected. It‚Äôs one of the best horror genre games that I have played to date. A bonus point would be if you would happen to have a PS VR, to play it on. The horror just intensifies.Tom Clancy‚Äôs The Division 2 (PlayStation 4, Xbox One, PC)This game can be is the most relatable in the current scenario. Your character is a part of an elite squad must re-establish peace in a lawless America, set in the aftermath of a viral (weaponised smallpox). To some, it might feel borderline offensive. So play at your own risk.FIFA 2020 (PlayStation 4, Xbox One, PC)To get out of the dark and gritty, you can play the new FIFA 2020, which has been developed by Volta and EA in collaboration. This collaboration provides us with two games at once, FIFA Street and FIFA. This helps the gamers change to a different version of FIFA when bored. It is quite an interesting and fun game that helps you have the fun of watching football even when there are no football matches taking place.NFS Heat (PlayStation 4, Xbox One, PC)If racing games is your genre then NFS Heat is the game that you need to play. It brings back the memories that you might have made while playing the original NFS Most Wanted. It is basically Most Wanted on steroids with better graphics and controls. However, not all is good and the fact that you need to shift between day and night and complete some missions in between just make the game a tad bit boring.Assassin‚Äôs Creed Odyssey (PlayStation 4, Xbox One, PC)Assassin‚Äôs Creed Odyssey is a very long game (40+ hours), so you won‚Äôt be running out of the storyline anytime soon. And it basically lets you do what any other Assassin‚Äôs Creed game allows you to do, and that is jumping, exploring and assassinating. It a fun game, and even though I have not completed it, it intrigued me enough to recommend it to everybody.The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the WildThis is a game that tells the story as to what happened when Link is trying to repair the damage that happened during a 100-year-old war that Link and Princess Zelda lost against Ganon. There is a lot of exploration that is needed to be done and it has an interesting story line that can provide you with a fun time during this lockdown.Pokemon Sword and Pokemon ShieldPokemon games that are available for Nintendo consoles are extremely engaging and fun. The last Pokemon game I played was Pokemon Black and from what I have seen in the trailers, it is a must have game. With it you get to travel the fictional Pokemon world, capturing various different Pokemons and then battling it out to be the best.Super Mario Maker 2Mario has been one of the most popular video game characters owned by Nintendo ever since its first game was launched. The character since then has been featured in multiple game series. Super Mario Maker 2 lets gamers create their own custom courses using assets from various games across the Super Mario franchise and then play them themselves or share them online for others to play. It reminds users of the older days, when they used to play Super Marios Bros on an 8-bit gaming console.üì£ The Indian Express is now on Telegram.

We have already discussed how fraudsters are posing as WHO officials to carry out phishing attacks, tricking people to click on malicious links or download harmful content, registering new malicious websites related to COVID-19, putting up fake coronavirus apps¬†and setting up fake COVID-19 tracking dashboards to hack computers.Now there is a new scam doing the rounds. A new report by Sophos ‚Äî a British security software and hardware company ‚Äî shows that cybercriminals are using extortion emails claiming they will infect a user‚Äôs family with coronavirus if the user does not pay the ransom money.Sextortion is well-known among people where cybercriminals send ‚Äúdirty little secret‚Äô emails saying they‚Äôve got hold of the user‚Äôs compromising pictures via malware and they‚Äôll leak it to the whole world, including their friends and family‚Äî unless the user decides to pay them a hefty amount of ransom money.In the new trend, criminals have tweaked the extortion to match up with the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. Cybercriminals are sending emails asking for $4000 via Bitcoins or else they‚Äôll not only reveal secrets, but will infect every member of the victim‚Äôs family with coronavirus.To sound authentic and get the person‚Äôs attention, the sender first reveals the password that was previously used by the victim. They claim they know all the passwords and that they have been keeping a close watch on the user, and could even infect their family with coronavirus. The email also includes a threat to reveal all of the user‚Äôs secrets.

https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/after-scrapping-mobile-world-congress-organiser-gsma-offers-refunds-6331442/,"After scrapping Mobile World Congress, organiser GSMA offers refunds",2020-03-25 19:11:15+05:30,"The organiser of the world‚Äôs biggest mobile technology conference, MWC 2020 in Barcelona, will offer refunds or discounts to future gatherings to the tens of thousands of attendees and companies that had paid to attend February‚Äôs canceled event.
MWC was an early major casualty of the coronavirus pandemic, and it had never been scrapped in its 33-year history. By removing it from the calendar, telecom heavyweights lost a significant opportunity to generate marketing buzz around their latest wares. The industry‚Äôs biggest players often spend tens of millions of dollars to exhibit at the show, and smaller ones pay in the hundreds of thousands.On Wednesday the GSMA, the trade body for the mobile technology industry, said in a statement it will offer full refunds to all attendees for the cost of their tickets, which cost 799 euros ($865) for a basic admissions pass. For large exhibitors, the GSMA wants to incentivize discounts on attending the show in future years as an alternative to claiming large refunds.Mats Granryd, the director general of the GSMA, said in an interview with Bloomberg at the time MWC was canceled that the trade body was ‚Äúlooking for solidarity‚Äù and everybody bearing their own costs.It looks like that may be happening, to some extent. Some large operators have already expressed to the GSMA their intention to participate in MWC next year, according to a person with direct knowledge of the situation. These include Orange SA, Telefonica SA, Vodafone Group Plc and NTT Docomo.Larger companies will get the option of receiving a credit worth 125% of what they paid to exhibit at this year‚Äôs show, which will be applied as a 65% discount on the cost of attending next year, plus 35% and 25% discounts on the two subsequent years respectively.Alternatively, they can claim refunds equivalent to 50% of their spend for MWC 2020, up to a maximum of 150,000 pounds ($178,000).For smaller exhibitors ‚Äî those who spent up to 5,000 pounds ‚Äî a full refund will be offered. However, these firms can also opt to waive a refund and instead be granted a 125% credit and three years of discounts.Companies that had canceled their attendance prior to the GSMA calling of the show will be offered credits and discounts, but not cash refunds. The GSMA‚Äôs board is made up of executives from a number of the world‚Äôs biggest operators, including Vodafone and Deutsche Telekom AG, who agreed to the initial cancellation. The GSMA isn‚Äôt expecting its operator members to seek refunds.About 80% of the GSMA‚Äôs annual budget is derived from the money it generates from MWC Barcelona, according to two people familiar with the group‚Äôs budget.But internally, executives don‚Äôt consider the cancellation of MWC 2020 and Wednesday‚Äôs offer of refunds to be an existential threat, according to an executive with direct knowledge of board-level conversations who didn‚Äôt want to be named discussing private matters.üì£ The Indian Express is now on Telegram.

https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-reviews/mi-dual-driver-in-ear-earphones-review-balanced-audio-at-a-budget-6331406/,Mi Dual Driver In-ear Earphones review: Balanced audio at a budget?,2020-03-26 12:48:10+05:30,"The Indian consumer puts a lot of emphasis on bass when it comes to audio preferences that‚Äôs why a lot of manufacturers focus primarily on lows in their speakers and headphones. However, it has led to the neglect of mids and highs in earphones‚Äî at least in the budget segment leaving you no with no choice, but to shell out more money to go for a premium offering for balanced audio.That‚Äôs the problem Xiaomi claims to have solved with its Mi Dual Driver In-ear Earphones, but is this affordable product able to deliver what it claims? The product is priced competitively at Rs 799 and here‚Äôs what I think about the product after a month of usage.Right from the get-go, the Mi Dual Driver In-ear Earphones remind of the Realme Buds 2. It has a braided cable, the earpiece sets have magnetic ends, the mic is affixed on the right cord with volume rockers and play/pause buttons.Although Realme‚Äôs offering looked more premium than Xiaomi‚Äôs product, there are few things that I liked in the Mi Dual Driver In-ear Earphones. These are light-weight earbuds; I could use the earphones straight for three-hours without feeling the urge to take them out. The plastic cover over the magnetic end that saves the paint from scratches. Also, there is kevlar-style design underneath the plastic and it looks quite good.The anodized aluminium earbuds have a matte finish that is fingerprint-resistant and looks good too‚Äîespecially the blue-coloured variant. The earbuds tips are angular in shape and ensure a better fit. You also get additional tips in the box with different sizes so you can switch them with the right size.The overall design looks sturdy and the braided cable prevents the wires from tangling. I kept the earphones in my pockets and laptop bag and never had to struggle to untangle it. The Mi Dual Driver In-ear Earphones come with an L-shaped connector that is definitely more practical.The right cable in the Y-splitter carries the microphone and remote which falls within the reach. The buttons are tactile and the mic works just fine. Also since the mic hangs at the right height, you do not need to adjust it while receiving or making a call.Coming to the sound quality, Mi Dual Driver In-ear Earphones come with Dual Driver ‚Äî one 10mm and another 8mm Dynamic Driver. Xiaomi says that one driver handles the low frequencies while the other takes care of mids and highs. However, in practical usage, I did not feel much of a difference.The Mi Dual Driver In-ear Earphones are mostly bass-heavy and you can feel the strong lows while listening to bass-centric tracks. People who like strong bass will definitely like this.Express Tech is now on Telegram. Click here to join our channel (@expresstechnology) and stay updated with the latest tech newsI was really hoping that Xiaomi‚Äôs claims regarding the efficient handling of mids and highs come true, but looks like there is much work to do. The highs are acceptable, but mids are not that clear as the bass boost spills over here.

https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/cold-flu-or-covid-19-this-ai-tool-can-help-you-differentiate-6331334/,"Cold, flu or Covid-19? This AI tool can help you differentiate",2020-03-26 21:16:52+05:30,"The coronavirus is confusing for the common man, since its similar to any common flu. And this creates confusion about who can, or should, get tested. To tackle this problem, Sydney-based Medius Health has created Quro, a risk assessment tool to determine whether you should be tested for Covid-19 or not. The AI digital health startup run by Indian Abhi Bhatia has so far done more than 75,000 consultations since rolling out the tool on March 4 in India and Australia.‚ÄúWhen Covid-19 hit, we had enough understanding of how we can utilise our medical knowledge graph at the backend and developed an AI-powered risk assessment tool which presents the users with questions related to symptoms and risk factors in accordance with the World Health Organisation protocols and guidelines,‚Äù the founder of Medius Health told indianexpress.com over phone from Sydney.Quro, an AI-based risk assessment tool, is like an anonymous consultation where people do not need to sign up or give personal details. The tool, which acts as a virtual health guide, asks a number of questions such as your travel history, past medical history, your symptoms, what sort of problems you are having right now from a symptomatic point of view and so on. The tool is free to use and can be accessed on the web.But collecting the data is one part of the story, says Bhatia. His team, which consists of data scientists and clinical scientists, has created an artificial intelligence (AI) system called disease frequency and evoking strength that extracts the data and using different combinations, it understands the relation between symptoms and disease. And based on that, its AI system predicts whether a person is at higher risk for getting sick from Covid-19 or not.The system gets updated frequently, based on the data and the trend provided by the World Health Organisation (WHO) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). ‚ÄúWe keep on updating the prevalence rate value of those relationships between coronavirus and a particular symptom. So for instance, when coronavirus started picking up, the doctors realised that nasal congestion is the one thing that actually differentiates between a flu as well as coronavirus, but then a lot of things have changed,‚Äù he said.Bhatia said the aim was to ‚Äúquell the panic‚Äù and at the same time offer ‚Äúthe right set of information‚Äù so that people should know that this could be a mere cold and flu and not Covid-19. He further added that the tool will help identify those people who have a high risk of Coronavirus and need to get the testing done.The tool [Quro] will help people understand how to differentiate between symptoms that are more relevant to coronavirus versus influenza. That is the biggest problem right now because everyone who‚Äôs coughing and has some sort of nasal congestion, they feel that it‚Äôs a coronavirus and it‚Äôs creating a lot of panic among people,‚Äù he explains.Citing the example of India, Bhatia said the risk assessment tool could be useful for a country with a population of 1 billion, where unnecessary fear among people about Covid-19 can put a lot of burden on hospitals and healthcare institutions.According to Bhatia, 69.2 per cent of people from India who have accessed the risk indicator have lower chances of contracting Covid-19, 22.7 per cent of profiles fall in the moderate risk category and just 9.1 per cent of people are at a higher risk of complications from the deadly virus.Bhatia feels that the tool can help government agencies and health organisations in understanding the magnitude of Covid 19 and take necessary steps before it gets too late to stop it from spreading.The company has reached out to the Ministry of Health to push out the risk assessment tool to a large population base in India. Meanwhile, Medius Health is working with a couple of partners in India to deploy the tool, including ICICI Prudential and Bajaj Financial Services. The company is also developing a special platform for Max Healthcare.It took Bhatia and his team 8-9 days to develop the tool. ‚ÄúBefore we roll out any AI tool, we train the model and then we have to do internal testing. In this case, we created different kinds of case simulations that we picked up from Wuhan. For instance, who was traveling, where these people were traveling, what was the age group, what was the gender, what geographical patterns that they have, what was the onset of symptoms? So we picked up that data from WHO and created AI-driven case simulations that we then injected into our platform,‚Äù he said.At a time when the developed countries like the US and Italy are failing to stop the coronavirus outbreak, Bhatia acknowledged that the use of Artificial intelligence (AI) can be a game-changer in healthcare.‚ÄúAI comes into play as early detection, collecting the data on a mass scale so that we can create epidemiological population-level information through which the government can allocate the resources at the right place, and put people in the right bucket. So if there‚Äôs a high-risk person, he should be the one who should be isolated first and get proper testing done,‚Äù Bhatia said.He further that those data points will further help train models and the AI engine would even be able to predict within those high-risk people who are least touched to coronavirus and who are more prone to infectious disease.Medius Health, which was founded in 2017, has a team of 32 people including data scientists, doctors and software engineers. The startup has so far raised AUD 4.2 million in two rounds and is looking to close its Series A from a consortium of investors from India and Singapore.üì£ The Indian Express is now on Telegram.

https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/coronavirus-internet-speeds-slow-netflix-hotstar-amazon-prime-youtube-reduce-streaming-quality-6331237/,"Coronavirus impact: As internet speeds fall, streaming services forced to dial down quality",2020-03-26 11:02:43+05:30,"The coronavirus pandemic is breaking the internet, in every sense of the word. Trends observed by Ookla, known for its SpeedTest app and website, show that across the world fixed broadband and mobile broadband networks are seeing a decline in their speeds, ranging from 10 per cent to 20 per cent in some cases. The reason: more and more people are now in lockdown, working from home, and with children staying back as well, there is increased burden on networks.One major factor for this is video, according to Doug Suttles, Co-founder and General Manager at Ookla. ‚ÄúOver half of the internet uses video. Anything else is small in comparison. The issue is that everyone‚Äôs working from home and suddenly kids don‚Äôt have school and they are home too. There‚Äôs a whole lot more video consumption. It‚Äôs gotten a lot larger,‚Äù Suttles explains, adding that ISPs cannot add capacity overnight to their networks.To give some context, JustWatch, an international streaming guide, has seen a 60 per cent spike in traffic from India and 81 per cent from US. So world over streaming services are now working to reduce the load. In India too, most major streaming players have followed suit and announced measures.YouTube, for which India is the biggest market in terms of consumers, confirmed Tuesday it was reducing its default video quality to standard definition across the world. In India, YouTube streaming will be at 480p on mobile networks by default until April 14, which is when the official lockdown declared by the government is supposed to end.‚ÄúWe continue to work closely with governments and network operators around the globe to do our part to minimise stress on the system during this unprecedented situation. Last week, we announced that we were temporarily defaulting all videos on YouTube to standard definition in the EU. Given the global nature of this crisis, we will expand that change globally starting today,‚Äù a Google spokesperson says on this change.Read our guide on how to ensure that streaming websites don‚Äôt consume all your data¬†Other players in India like Sony, Facebook, Amazon Prime Video, Viacom18, Zee, Hotstar, TikTok and MX Player have also agreed to stream at SD or standard definition content, in order to ensure there is no strain on the networks, which will consume less data.In a collective decision, the companies have announced they will temporarily be defaulting HD and ultra-HD streaming to SD content or offering only SD content at bitrates no higher than 480p on cellular networks. The measures will stay in effect till April 14.Meanwhile, Netflix has decided to reduce load on the telecommunications networks in India by 25 per cent, while maintaining the quality of service for the next 30 days. ‚ÄúGiven the crisis, we‚Äôve developed a way to reduce Netflix‚Äôs traffic on telecommunications networks by 25% while also maintaining the quality of our service. So consumers should continue to get the quality that comes with their plan ‚Äì whether it‚Äôs Ultra-High, High or Standard Definition,‚Äù says Ken Florance, VP Content Delivery, Netflix in a statement.Work from Home appears to be the norm for many of us. We at Indian Express tech have some articles which could help make this easier. First, how to optimise your WiFi, which is really important. Read on that here. Next, we explain how to save data on WhatsApp given we might be using a lot more of this. Then we explain how you can balance screen time while doing work from home. Also these video calling apps can be useful when relying on work from home. Don‚Äôt let it be all about work, you can rely on these fitness apps to continue that workout during the lockdown. And finally some general tips to keep in mind while working from home. So if a customer wants to continue streaming at a higher resolution, and their plan allows the option, the content will be available at that UHD or HD or SD resolution, except the streaming will be at a lower bitrate. The company has removed the highest bandwidth streams in order to reduce load on the networks.While on-demand video streaming platforms are working to reduce the load on networks, there‚Äôs no doubt that the increased demand has impacted speeds in India already. The good news is that Ookla‚Äôs numbers showed that while fixed or wired broadband has declined at some level in India, it is not so sharp.But mobile broadband has seen a steeper decline of about 10 per cent across networks. The data shows that in India there is also a 5 per cent decline in upload speeds for mobile and fixed broadband as well.‚ÄúThe trends are similar in India to what we are seeing over the world. Week-over-week, there‚Äôs a clear uptick in testing. People are concerned with their network, having issues and wanting to solve those problems. In India, we are seeing about a 10 per cent decline in performance for mobile broadband networks, though the fixed broadband networks have not seen such a sharp decline,‚Äù Suttles says.The decline in mobile networks is not surprising if one looks at the numbers put out by the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) on the number of subscribers for mobile vs fixed broadband. Wired broadband connections stood at 19.13 million subscribers as seen on December 31, 2019. In contrast, the number of mobile broadband subscribers stands at 642 million. For many mobile is the primary and only form of internet connectivity and in these congested times, the networks will face an increased burden.More around coronavirus impact on the tech worldSamsung, Oppo, vivo shut down factories in India | Coronavirus outbreak is impacting Indian smartphone market | From Kerala, a robot to take care of coronavirus patientsIn countries where work from home has been mandated, and is being followed, there is a 10 to 20 per cent reduction in performance. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs different in some countries is that it has affected mobile broadband more. India is an example of that. In the United States, it has impacted fixed broadband but mobile speeds have stayed the same,‚Äù explains Suttles.Another trend that Ookla has observed is that there is a general uptick in the number of people running speed tests to check on internet quality. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs interesting because usually it happens more often in the evening for fixed broadband when people come home from work. People are testing throughout the day and night now. More mobile tests used to happen typically during the day, but now we are seeing all kinds of tests throughout the day,‚Äù he adds.It is not just video streaming services that are working to optimise their services. Content Delivery Networks (CDN‚Äôs) such as Akamai are also working to reduce traffic congestion.Akamai announced it will work with leading distributors of software, particularly for the gaming industry, including Microsoft and Sony, to help manage congestion during peak usage periods. Gaming software downloads account for large amounts of internet traffic and it will be crucial to manage this, especially as more people are staying home.Express Tech is now on Telegram. Click here to join our channel (@expresstechie) and stay updated with the latest tech news‚ÄúAkamai‚Äôs intelligent edge network architecture is inherently designed to mitigate and minimise network congestion, and because we have deployed our infrastructure deep into carrier networks, we can help those networks avoid overload by diverting traffic away from areas experiencing high levels of congestion,‚Äù a statement quotes Dr Tom Leighton, the CEO and Co-Founder of Akamai.In regions where demand is creating bottlenecks for customers, Akamai will be reducing gaming software downloads at peak times, and completing the downloads at the normal fast speeds late at night. The approach, it says, will ensure that while gamers can still get their downloads, health workers will not face any issues with the digital services that are vital.Another consequence of the lockdowns is more usage of VPN or Virtual Private Networks, which can help users access websites or content which might not be allowed in their country. According to ExpressVPN, it has seen an increase of 21 per cent in the average global usage of its service since the end of February. In India, there‚Äôs been a growth of 15 per cent in VPN usage.‚ÄúWe are seeing strong demand in our services as more people spend more time indoors and employees around the world telework,‚Äù says a statement from Harold Li, vice president, ExpressVPN.But how long will the strain on the networks continue? The Ookla co-founder gives the example of China and how the situation played out there, where the coronavirus outbreak began and was followed by a lockdown in Wuhan.‚ÄúSix weeks ago, China looked like the other parts of the world do now, where everyone shifted to working from home. There were a lot of slowdowns on the internet. It took five to six weeks for things to return to normal there. But as of the last two weeks, it looks like it used to before,‚Äù he points out.In his view, if the lockdowns and social distancing measures are adhered to, and everyone does stay home, it would take a month or so for internet speeds to get back to normal, though he cautions, it will depend on the number of people actually staying at home.üì£ The Indian Express is now on Telegram.

Due to this internet consumption has gone up drastically given people are either playing games or watching movies or making video calls with friends and family members living far away. People are also depending a lot on OTT platforms for entertainment.Streaming services like Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, and some others have reduced their video quality in order to offer a smooth viewing experience at least during the lockdown period. There are a lot of streaming services available in India and a person who‚Äôs new to OTT platforms might get on about which one to opt for. To make it simple and easy for people to select streaming services and plans that suit them the best we have created a list of all the popular streaming services available in India, and explained how much they cost and the benefits they offer.Netflix is comparatively the most expensive streaming service platform currently available in India.

Called the COVID-19 CTI League, for cyber threat intelligence, the group spans more than 40 countries and includes professionals in senior positions at such major companies as Microsoft Corp and Amazon.com Inc.One of four initial managers of the effort, Marc Rogers, said the top priority would be working to combat hacks against medical facilities and other frontline responders to the pandemic. It is already working on hacks of health organizations. Also key is the defence of communication networks and services that have become essential as more people work from home, said Rogers, head of security at the long-running hacking conference Def Con and a vice president at security company Okta Inc.The group is also using its web of contacts in internet infrastructure providers to squash garden-variety phishing attacks and another financial crime that is using the fear of COVID-19 or the desire for information on it to trick regular internet users.‚ÄúI‚Äôve never seen this volume of phishing,‚Äù Rogers said. ‚ÄúI am literally seeing phishing messages in every language known to man.‚ÄùPhishing messages try to induce recipients to enter passwords or other sensitive information on websites controlled by the attackers, who then use the data to take control of bank, email or other accounts. Rogers said the group had already dismantled one campaign that used a software vulnerability to spread malicious software. He declined to provide details, and said that in general the group would be reluctant to reveal what it was fighting.Rogers said law enforcement had been surprisingly welcoming of the collaboration, recognising the vastness of the threat. Rogers is a UK citizen based in the San Francisco Bay Area. Two other group coordinators are American, and one is Israeli.‚ÄúI have never seen this level of cooperation,‚Äù Rogers said. ‚ÄúI hope it continues afterwards, because it‚Äôs a beautiful thing to see.‚Äùüì£ The Indian Express is now on Telegram.

The candidates have been preparing for the exam amidst the 21 days lockdown in their homes taking online classroom sessions and online test series. However, fraudsters are equally active in this period trying very hard to trick the aspirants and steal money.UPSC CSE candidates often receive promotional messages from coaching institutes marketing their preparation material and fraudsters also ride along with similar messages. But this time, cybercriminals are sending alerts to aspirants regarding ‚Äúimportant notification released due to Novel Coronavirus‚Äù with a link. We checked the link and here‚Äôs what we found.The URL takes you to a website where there is no such notification but an advertisement for test series. ‚ÄúDue to COVID-19 all students Please stay home. Our Expert Team Specially Designed Tests and study material. For all UPSC CSE 2020 aspirant [sic].‚ÄùThe website mentions that their test series is designed by ‚Äúprofessor from top university due to COVID-19‚Äù in order to help poor students. Usually, the price of IAS (Prelims + Mains) test series is priced at Rs 40,000 but the website claims to offer the test-series for as little as Rs 699, which is also refundable within 48 hours.The website also claims to offer free Netflix subscription ‚Äúdue to COVID-19‚Äù.With just a simple look at the website and its grammatically incorrect sentences makes it clear that this isn‚Äôt a legit website but is a scam. However, the domain ‚Äúiitmadras.online/upsc.html‚Äù ends up making it look authentic for some users ‚Äî especially to marginalised aspirants who don‚Äôt have enough money to enroll with a test-series program run by reputed coaching institutions.

Users who posted positive reviews of Wooe.in at Quora also claimed that it is run by IIT Madras.However, IIT Madras has denied its association with any such portal. Following is the notice issued by the IIT Madras:Wooe is not alone in running fake test-series or online coaching programs with prices too real to be true.

https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/mobile-tabs/before-razr-motorola-was-testing-tablet-style-foldable-phone-design-6332576/,"Before Razr, Motorola was testing tablet-style foldable phone design",2020-03-26 15:11:01+05:30,"Motorola‚Äôs original foldable device was a tablet-style phone, before it finalised the design of the new Razr. However, the company felt such a device was too large and thus veered in favour of a more compact, flip-style form factor.‚ÄúWe tested multiple prototypes. We tested a tablet-style too, but we wanted to have an ultra-compact design,‚Äù Prashanth Mani, Country Head, Lenovo Mobile Business Group and MD, Motorola Mobility, India, told indianexpress.com in a telephonic interview.The new Razr is a reboot of the iconic Razr flip phone from 2004. The revamped version, however, is a modern Android smartphone with a screen that measures 6.2-inch diagonal but folds in half. When fully closed, the device easily slips into a pocket.Motorola was first to launch the Razr foldable phone with a clamshell design late last year and soon Samsung followed with the Galaxy Z Flip. The Galaxy Z Flip too has a flip phone-style form factor but features a foldable glass screen and is cheaper than the Razr.Without getting into comparisons, Mani said both foldable phones have pros and cons. ‚ÄúI think both devices have their own uniqueness in this category,‚Äù he said.Like in the case of the Razr, the phone has a secondary 2.7-inch OLED screen on the outside of the clamshell for notifications when the phone is closed. The Galaxy Z Flip, in contrast, has a tiny 1.1-inch pill-shaped external display that is limited in functionality. The Razr is impressively thin and the hinge that allows the phone to lay completely flat. But where the Galaxy Z Flip scores over the Razr is on the display front and internal hardware. The Galaxy Z Flip is also cheaper in comparison to the Razr.‚ÄúThe design defined Razr for us. In every decision point, the look and feel of the device were kept in mind. So we have succeeded in our view in creating a device that embodies our code philosophy, simplicity, surprise, and richness,‚Äù he explains. Mani said it took the company four years to design the Razr and the team worked closely with Lenovo‚Äôs laptop team to perfect the hinge.Neither the Razr nor the Galaxy Z Flip is perfect, but many critics have found that the Razr is less powerful in terms of specifications. Some even had a harsh opinion on the average camera performance.Mani has defended the company‚Äôs decision to go with the Snapdragon 710 processor and a single 16MP camera on the Razr that costs Rs 124,999. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not just about megapixel or megabytes. It‚Äôs also about what the design bodies, what kind of craftsmanship goes into it, and what kind of material is used. We believe that these are things that make a phone premium today,‚Äù he says. He said that as the price band goes up, the most important thing people consider in a phone is the design language and craftsmanship.Whether a consumer chooses the Razr or the Galaxy Z Flip, both phones have fascinating new technology that‚Äôs largely untested on a large scale, and these phones are expensive to manufacture. Despite the high price of the Razr, Mani believes there is a set of customers who would want to spend the money on a foldable phone. ‚ÄúThe market is big enough for foldable phones,‚Äù he said confidently.¬†The new Razr‚Äôs Rs 124,999 price includes 18 per cent GST, which has increased the cost of the device in India. Fluctuation in the exchange rate and local duties have further added to the retail price of the Razr. The phone has been made in China and not in India, where Motorola manufactures its other smartphones.Mani agrees that the foldable devices are in the early stages and it will take some time to see the growth in the category. ‚ÄúThe foldable itself is at a very nascent phase but we think the category will grow significantly over the next one or two years,‚Äù he said, adding that the company will continue to invest in the foldable tech and work with our partners to develop further functionalities on it.‚ÄùOne big feature the Razr lacks is the 5G connectivity. Although 5G networks are not going to be live in India this year, if you are going to spend Rs 124,999 on a phone, you might expect the feature to be there in the device. However, Mani said the company‚Äôs priority was to get the foldable phone right and 5G was not something Motorola aimed to add in the Razr.Motorola hasn‚Äôt announced a 5G smartphone yet, but the company is looking at this space closely. In fact, both foldables and 5G are important areas for Motorola in the coming years.Mani was tightlipped on the company‚Äôs next foldable phone, but he did say that the team is evaluating multiple designs and form factors. Virtually every smartphone maker is working on foldable smartphones and trying to perfect the technology.The new Razr, which was intended to go on sale from April 2 in India, could be delayed further due to the three-week pan-India lockdown. The country has been put under complete lockdown for 21 days in an aim to curtail the spread of coronavirus in the nation of 1.3 billion people. Flipkart, the exclusive online partner to sell the Razr, has temporarily suspended operations in view of the 21-day lockdown. The phone was also supposed to be available from the top 200 offline stores in India.üì£ The Indian Express is now on Telegram.

This game allows you to play Ludo with your friends wherever they are and chat with them via voice or text. You can also play the game with your family members or roommates. You can also connect with random people and make new friends.Asphalt 9: LegendsAsphalt 9: Legends is a pure racing game, that will be able to give you most of the thrill that a real race car would be able to. Asphalt 9: Legends is the best the series has to offer as of now in terms of graphics and controls. Another feature is that they also have a licence from a lot of car companies to use their car names and designs. Thus, providing you with the extra bit of realism.Subscription service (PlayStation 4, Xbox One)My first option would be to get the PlayStation Plus or Xbox Gold service as it will provide you with a number of free games that you can play during this quarantine. It is more fun as you do not know which games will come up the following month, hence helping you grow as a gamer, by pushing you to play different genres of games.The Last of Us (PlayStation 4)Read the name of the game. Yes, that is what it is. Sure coronavirus is not turning people into hideous monsters, but it is no joke.¬† This game will help provide you with a vent as you try and stay alive in a post-apocalyptic Earth where you‚Äôre likely to be killed by other humans. This game might make people anxious about the future, so we recommend that you play this with caution.Resident Evil 7: Biohazard (PlayStation 4, Xbox One, PC)Resident Evil is a series that comes to any gamers mind, when you say the word zombie. And why would it not, it is one of the best zombie games there is, with the right amount of thrill, horror and storyline.Why I chose this version to recommend you is because in this you are trapped in a home, with the Baker family that is very bad at social distancing and is confirmed to be infected. It‚Äôs one of the best horror genre games that I have played to date. A bonus point would be if you would happen to have a PS VR, to play it on. The horror just intensifies.Tom Clancy‚Äôs The Division 2 (PlayStation 4, Xbox One, PC)This game can be is the most relatable in the current scenario. Your character is a part of an elite squad must re-establish peace in a lawless America, set in the aftermath of a viral (weaponised smallpox). To some, it might feel borderline offensive. So play at your own risk.FIFA 2020 (PlayStation 4, Xbox One, PC)To get out of the dark and gritty, you can play the new FIFA 2020, which has been developed by Volta and EA in collaboration. This collaboration provides us with two games at once, FIFA Street and FIFA. This helps the gamers change to a different version of FIFA when bored. It is quite an interesting and fun game that helps you have the fun of watching football even when there are no football matches taking place.NFS Heat (PlayStation 4, Xbox One, PC)If racing games is your genre then NFS Heat is the game that you need to play. It brings back the memories that you might have made while playing the original NFS Most Wanted. It is basically Most Wanted on steroids with better graphics and controls. However, not all is good and the fact that you need to shift between day and night and complete some missions in between just make the game a tad bit boring.Assassin‚Äôs Creed Odyssey (PlayStation 4, Xbox One, PC)Assassin‚Äôs Creed Odyssey is a very long game (40+ hours), so you won‚Äôt be running out of the storyline anytime soon. And it basically lets you do what any other Assassin‚Äôs Creed game allows you to do, and that is jumping, exploring and assassinating. It a fun game, and even though I have not completed it, it intrigued me enough to recommend it to everybody.The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the WildThis is a game that tells the story as to what happened when Link is trying to repair the damage that happened during a 100-year-old war that Link and Princess Zelda lost against Ganon. There is a lot of exploration that is needed to be done and it has an interesting story line that can provide you with a fun time during this lockdown.Pokemon Sword and Pokemon ShieldPokemon games that are available for Nintendo consoles are extremely engaging and fun. The last Pokemon game I played was Pokemon Black and from what I have seen in the trailers, it is a must have game. With it you get to travel the fictional Pokemon world, capturing various different Pokemons and then battling it out to be the best.Super Mario Maker 2Mario has been one of the most popular video game characters owned by Nintendo ever since its first game was launched. The character since then has been featured in multiple game series. Super Mario Maker 2 lets gamers create their own custom courses using assets from various games across the Super Mario franchise and then play them themselves or share them online for others to play. It reminds users of the older days, when they used to play Super Marios Bros on an 8-bit gaming console.üì£ The Indian Express is now on Telegram.

We have already discussed how fraudsters are posing as WHO officials to carry out phishing attacks, tricking people to click on malicious links or download harmful content, registering new malicious websites related to COVID-19, putting up fake coronavirus apps¬†and setting up fake COVID-19 tracking dashboards to hack computers.Now there is a new scam doing the rounds. A new report by Sophos ‚Äî a British security software and hardware company ‚Äî shows that cybercriminals are using extortion emails claiming they will infect a user‚Äôs family with coronavirus if the user does not pay the ransom money.Sextortion is well-known among people where cybercriminals send ‚Äúdirty little secret‚Äô emails saying they‚Äôve got hold of the user‚Äôs compromising pictures via malware and they‚Äôll leak it to the whole world, including their friends and family‚Äî unless the user decides to pay them a hefty amount of ransom money.In the new trend, criminals have tweaked the extortion to match up with the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. Cybercriminals are sending emails asking for $4000 via Bitcoins or else they‚Äôll not only reveal secrets, but will infect every member of the victim‚Äôs family with coronavirus.To sound authentic and get the person‚Äôs attention, the sender first reveals the password that was previously used by the victim. They claim they know all the passwords and that they have been keeping a close watch on the user, and could even infect their family with coronavirus. The email also includes a threat to reveal all of the user‚Äôs secrets. Check out the whole email in the screenshot attached below:There‚Äôs a chance they could have extracted your password from publicly available data leaked in an old data breach. So even if the whole this is a scam, what do to now? Paul Ducklin, the Principal Research Scientist at Sophos, explains that there is no need to be scared. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt send any money.

https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/after-scrapping-mobile-world-congress-organiser-gsma-offers-refunds-6331442/,"After scrapping Mobile World Congress, organiser GSMA offers refunds",2020-03-25 19:11:15+05:30,"The organiser of the world‚Äôs biggest mobile technology conference, MWC 2020 in Barcelona, will offer refunds or discounts to future gatherings to the tens of thousands of attendees and companies that had paid to attend February‚Äôs canceled event.
MWC was an early major casualty of the coronavirus pandemic, and it had never been scrapped in its 33-year history. By removing it from the calendar, telecom heavyweights lost a significant opportunity to generate marketing buzz around their latest wares. The industry‚Äôs biggest players often spend tens of millions of dollars to exhibit at the show, and smaller ones pay in the hundreds of thousands.On Wednesday the GSMA, the trade body for the mobile technology industry, said in a statement it will offer full refunds to all attendees for the cost of their tickets, which cost 799 euros ($865) for a basic admissions pass. For large exhibitors, the GSMA wants to incentivize discounts on attending the show in future years as an alternative to claiming large refunds.Mats Granryd, the director general of the GSMA, said in an interview with Bloomberg at the time MWC was canceled that the trade body was ‚Äúlooking for solidarity‚Äù and everybody bearing their own costs.It looks like that may be happening, to some extent. Some large operators have already expressed to the GSMA their intention to participate in MWC next year, according to a person with direct knowledge of the situation. These include Orange SA, Telefonica SA, Vodafone Group Plc and NTT Docomo.Larger companies will get the option of receiving a credit worth 125% of what they paid to exhibit at this year‚Äôs show, which will be applied as a 65% discount on the cost of attending next year, plus 35% and 25% discounts on the two subsequent years respectively.Alternatively, they can claim refunds equivalent to 50% of their spend for MWC 2020, up to a maximum of 150,000 pounds ($178,000).For smaller exhibitors ‚Äî those who spent up to 5,000 pounds ‚Äî a full refund will be offered. However, these firms can also opt to waive a refund and instead be granted a 125% credit and three years of discounts.Companies that had canceled their attendance prior to the GSMA calling of the show will be offered credits and discounts, but not cash refunds. The GSMA‚Äôs board is made up of executives from a number of the world‚Äôs biggest operators, including Vodafone and Deutsche Telekom AG, who agreed to the initial cancellation. The GSMA isn‚Äôt expecting its operator members to seek refunds.About 80% of the GSMA‚Äôs annual budget is derived from the money it generates from MWC Barcelona, according to two people familiar with the group‚Äôs budget.But internally, executives don‚Äôt consider the cancellation of MWC 2020 and Wednesday‚Äôs offer of refunds to be an existential threat, according to an executive with direct knowledge of board-level conversations who didn‚Äôt want to be named discussing private matters.üì£ The Indian Express is now on Telegram.

https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-reviews/mi-dual-driver-in-ear-earphones-review-balanced-audio-at-a-budget-6331406/,Mi Dual Driver In-ear Earphones review: Balanced audio at a budget?,2020-03-26 12:48:10+05:30,"The Indian consumer puts a lot of emphasis on bass when it comes to audio preferences that‚Äôs why a lot of manufacturers focus primarily on lows in their speakers and headphones. However, it has led to the neglect of mids and highs in earphones‚Äî at least in the budget segment leaving you no with no choice, but to shell out more money to go for a premium offering for balanced audio.That‚Äôs the problem Xiaomi claims to have solved with its Mi Dual Driver In-ear Earphones, but is this affordable product able to deliver what it claims? The product is priced competitively at Rs 799 and here‚Äôs what I think about the product after a month of usage.Right from the get-go, the Mi Dual Driver In-ear Earphones remind of the Realme Buds 2. It has a braided cable, the earpiece sets have magnetic ends, the mic is affixed on the right cord with volume rockers and play/pause buttons.Although Realme‚Äôs offering looked more premium than Xiaomi‚Äôs product, there are few things that I liked in the Mi Dual Driver In-ear Earphones. These are light-weight earbuds; I could use the earphones straight for three-hours without feeling the urge to take them out. The plastic cover over the magnetic end that saves the paint from scratches. Also, there is kevlar-style design underneath the plastic and it looks quite good.The anodized aluminium earbuds have a matte finish that is fingerprint-resistant and looks good too‚Äîespecially the blue-coloured variant. The earbuds tips are angular in shape and ensure a better fit. You also get additional tips in the box with different sizes so you can switch them with the right size.The overall design looks sturdy and the braided cable prevents the wires from tangling. I kept the earphones in my pockets and laptop bag and never had to struggle to untangle it. The Mi Dual Driver In-ear Earphones come with an L-shaped connector that is definitely more practical.The right cable in the Y-splitter carries the microphone and remote which falls within the reach. The buttons are tactile and the mic works just fine. Also since the mic hangs at the right height, you do not need to adjust it while receiving or making a call.Coming to the sound quality, Mi Dual Driver In-ear Earphones come with Dual Driver ‚Äî one 10mm and another 8mm Dynamic Driver. Xiaomi says that one driver handles the low frequencies while the other takes care of mids and highs. However, in practical usage, I did not feel much of a difference.The Mi Dual Driver In-ear Earphones are mostly bass-heavy and you can feel the strong lows while listening to bass-centric tracks. People who like strong bass will definitely like this.Express Tech is now on Telegram. Click here to join our channel (@expresstechnology) and stay updated with the latest tech newsI was really hoping that Xiaomi‚Äôs claims regarding the efficient handling of mids and highs come true, but looks like there is much work to do. The highs are acceptable, but mids are not that clear as the bass boost spills over here. You can feel the effect even when you listen to podcasts.Overall, the Mi Dual Driver In-ear Earphones do not offer a balanced audio experience but are perfect as a daily driver and for bass-heavy soundtracks. For those who want budget earphones under Rs 1,000 can definitely consider Mi Dual Driver In-ear Earphones for its light-weight design and bass-heavy performance.üì£ The Indian Express is now on Telegram.

https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/cold-flu-or-covid-19-this-ai-tool-can-help-you-differentiate-6331334/,"Cold, flu or Covid-19? This AI tool can help you differentiate",2020-03-26 21:16:52+05:30,"The coronavirus is confusing for the common man, since its similar to any common flu. And this creates confusion about who can, or should, get tested. To tackle this problem, Sydney-based Medius Health has created Quro, a risk assessment tool to determine whether you should be tested for Covid-19 or not. The AI digital health startup run by Indian Abhi Bhatia has so far done more than 75,000 consultations since rolling out the tool on March 4 in India and Australia.‚ÄúWhen Covid-19 hit, we had enough understanding of how we can utilise our medical knowledge graph at the backend and developed an AI-powered risk assessment tool which presents the users with questions related to symptoms and risk factors in accordance with the World Health Organisation protocols and guidelines,‚Äù the founder of Medius Health told indianexpress.com over phone from Sydney.Quro, an AI-based risk assessment tool, is like an anonymous consultation where people do not need to sign up or give personal details. The tool, which acts as a virtual health guide, asks a number of questions such as your travel history, past medical history, your symptoms, what sort of problems you are having right now from a symptomatic point of view and so on. The tool is free to use and can be accessed on the web.But collecting the data is one part of the story, says Bhatia. His team, which consists of data scientists and clinical scientists, has created an artificial intelligence (AI) system called disease frequency and evoking strength that extracts the data and using different combinations, it understands the relation between symptoms and disease. And based on that, its AI system predicts whether a person is at higher risk for getting sick from Covid-19 or not.The system gets updated frequently, based on the data and the trend provided by the World Health Organisation (WHO) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). ‚ÄúWe keep on updating the prevalence rate value of those relationships between coronavirus and a particular symptom. So for instance, when coronavirus started picking up, the doctors realised that nasal congestion is the one thing that actually differentiates between a flu as well as coronavirus, but then a lot of things have changed,‚Äù he said.Bhatia said the aim was to ‚Äúquell the panic‚Äù and at the same time offer ‚Äúthe right set of information‚Äù so that people should know that this could be a mere cold and flu and not Covid-19. He further added that the tool will help identify those people who have a high risk of Coronavirus and need to get the testing done.The tool [Quro] will help people understand how to differentiate between symptoms that are more relevant to coronavirus versus influenza. That is the biggest problem right now because everyone who‚Äôs coughing and has some sort of nasal congestion, they feel that it‚Äôs a coronavirus and it‚Äôs creating a lot of panic among people,‚Äù he explains.Citing the example of India, Bhatia said the risk assessment tool could be useful for a country with a population of 1 billion, where unnecessary fear among people about Covid-19 can put a lot of burden on hospitals and healthcare institutions.According to Bhatia, 69.2 per cent of people from India who have accessed the risk indicator have lower chances of contracting Covid-19, 22.7 per cent of profiles fall in the moderate risk category and just 9.1 per cent of people are at a higher risk of complications from the deadly virus.Bhatia feels that the tool can help government agencies and health organisations in understanding the magnitude of Covid 19 and take necessary steps before it gets too late to stop it from spreading.The company has reached out to the Ministry of Health to push out the risk assessment tool to a large population base in India. Meanwhile, Medius Health is working with a couple of partners in India to deploy the tool, including ICICI Prudential and Bajaj Financial Services. The company is also developing a special platform for Max Healthcare.It took Bhatia and his team 8-9 days to develop the tool. ‚ÄúBefore we roll out any AI tool, we train the model and then we have to do internal testing. In this case, we created different kinds of case simulations that we picked up from Wuhan. For instance, who was traveling, where these people were traveling, what was the age group, what was the gender, what geographical patterns that they have, what was the onset of symptoms? So we picked up that data from WHO and created AI-driven case simulations that we then injected into our platform,‚Äù he said.At a time when the developed countries like the US and Italy are failing to stop the coronavirus outbreak, Bhatia acknowledged that the use of Artificial intelligence (AI) can be a game-changer in healthcare.‚ÄúAI comes into play as early detection, collecting the data on a mass scale so that we can create epidemiological population-level information through which the government can allocate the resources at the right place, and put people in the right bucket. So if there‚Äôs a high-risk person, he should be the one who should be isolated first and get proper testing done,‚Äù Bhatia said.He further that those data points will further help train models and the AI engine would even be able to predict within those high-risk people who are least touched to coronavirus and who are more prone to infectious disease.Medius Health, which was founded in 2017, has a team of 32 people including data scientists, doctors and software engineers. The startup has so far raised AUD 4.2 million in two rounds and is looking to close its Series A from a consortium of investors from India and Singapore.üì£ The Indian Express is now on Telegram.

https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/coronavirus-internet-speeds-slow-netflix-hotstar-amazon-prime-youtube-reduce-streaming-quality-6331237/,"Coronavirus impact: As internet speeds fall, streaming services forced to dial down quality",2020-03-26 11:02:43+05:30,"The coronavirus pandemic is breaking the internet, in every sense of the word. Trends observed by Ookla, known for its SpeedTest app and website, show that across the world fixed broadband and mobile broadband networks are seeing a decline in their speeds, ranging from 10 per cent to 20 per cent in some cases. The reason: more and more people are now in lockdown, working from home, and with children staying back as well, there is increased burden on networks.One major factor for this is video, according to Doug Suttles, Co-founder and General Manager at Ookla. ‚ÄúOver half of the internet uses video. Anything else is small in comparison. The issue is that everyone‚Äôs working from home and suddenly kids don‚Äôt have school and they are home too. There‚Äôs a whole lot more video consumption. It‚Äôs gotten a lot larger,‚Äù Suttles explains, adding that ISPs cannot add capacity overnight to their networks.To give some context, JustWatch, an international streaming guide, has seen a 60 per cent spike in traffic from India and 81 per cent from US. So world over streaming services are now working to reduce the load. In India too, most major streaming players have followed suit and announced measures.YouTube, for which India is the biggest market in terms of consumers, confirmed Tuesday it was reducing its default video quality to standard definition across the world. In India, YouTube streaming will be at 480p on mobile networks by default until April 14, which is when the official lockdown declared by the government is supposed to end.‚ÄúWe continue to work closely with governments and network operators around the globe to do our part to minimise stress on the system during this unprecedented situation. Last week, we announced that we were temporarily defaulting all videos on YouTube to standard definition in the EU. Given the global nature of this crisis, we will expand that change globally starting today,‚Äù a Google spokesperson says on this change.Read our guide on how to ensure that streaming websites don‚Äôt consume all your data¬†Other players in India like Sony, Facebook, Amazon Prime Video, Viacom18, Zee, Hotstar, TikTok and MX Player have also agreed to stream at SD or standard definition content, in order to ensure there is no strain on the networks, which will consume less data.In a collective decision, the companies have announced they will temporarily be defaulting HD and ultra-HD streaming to SD content or offering only SD content at bitrates no higher than 480p on cellular networks. The measures will stay in effect till April 14.Meanwhile, Netflix has decided to reduce load on the telecommunications networks in India by 25 per cent, while maintaining the quality of service for the next 30 days. ‚ÄúGiven the crisis, we‚Äôve developed a way to reduce Netflix‚Äôs traffic on telecommunications networks by 25% while also maintaining the quality of our service. So consumers should continue to get the quality that comes with their plan ‚Äì whether it‚Äôs Ultra-High, High or Standard Definition,‚Äù says Ken Florance, VP Content Delivery, Netflix in a statement.Work from Home appears to be the norm for many of us. We at Indian Express tech have some articles which could help make this easier. First, how to optimise your WiFi, which is really important. Read on that here. Next, we explain how to save data on WhatsApp given we might be using a lot more of this. Then we explain how you can balance screen time while doing work from home. Also these video calling apps can be useful when relying on work from home. Don‚Äôt let it be all about work, you can rely on these fitness apps to continue that workout during the lockdown. And finally some general tips to keep in mind while working from home. So if a customer wants to continue streaming at a higher resolution, and their plan allows the option, the content will be available at that UHD or HD or SD resolution, except the streaming will be at a lower bitrate. The company has removed the highest bandwidth streams in order to reduce load on the networks.While on-demand video streaming platforms are working to reduce the load on networks, there‚Äôs no doubt that the increased demand has impacted speeds in India already. The good news is that Ookla‚Äôs numbers showed that while fixed or wired broadband has declined at some level in India, it is not so sharp.But mobile broadband has seen a steeper decline of about 10 per cent across networks. The data shows that in India there is also a 5 per cent decline in upload speeds for mobile and fixed broadband as well.‚ÄúThe trends are similar in India to what we are seeing over the world. Week-over-week, there‚Äôs a clear uptick in testing. People are concerned with their network, having issues and wanting to solve those problems. In India, we are seeing about a 10 per cent decline in performance for mobile broadband networks, though the fixed broadband networks have not seen such a sharp decline,‚Äù Suttles says.The decline in mobile networks is not surprising if one looks at the numbers put out by the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) on the number of subscribers for mobile vs fixed broadband. Wired broadband connections stood at 19.13 million subscribers as seen on December 31, 2019. In contrast, the number of mobile broadband subscribers stands at 642 million. For many mobile is the primary and only form of internet connectivity and in these congested times, the networks will face an increased burden.More around coronavirus impact on the tech worldSamsung, Oppo, vivo shut down factories in India | Coronavirus outbreak is impacting Indian smartphone market | From Kerala, a robot to take care of coronavirus patientsIn countries where work from home has been mandated, and is being followed, there is a 10 to 20 per cent reduction in performance. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs different in some countries is that it has affected mobile broadband more. India is an example of that. In the United States, it has impacted fixed broadband but mobile speeds have stayed the same,‚Äù explains Suttles.Another trend that Ookla has observed is that there is a general uptick in the number of people running speed tests to check on internet quality. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs interesting because usually it happens more often in the evening for fixed broadband when people come home from work. People are testing throughout the day and night now. More mobile tests used to happen typically during the day, but now we are seeing all kinds of tests throughout the day,‚Äù he adds.It is not just video streaming services that are working to optimise their services. Content Delivery Networks (CDN‚Äôs) such as Akamai are also working to reduce traffic congestion.Akamai announced it will work with leading distributors of software, particularly for the gaming industry, including Microsoft and Sony, to help manage congestion during peak usage periods. Gaming software downloads account for large amounts of internet traffic and it will be crucial to manage this, especially as more people are staying home.Express Tech is now on Telegram. Click here to join our channel (@expresstechie) and stay updated with the latest tech news‚ÄúAkamai‚Äôs intelligent edge network architecture is inherently designed to mitigate and minimise network congestion, and because we have deployed our infrastructure deep into carrier networks, we can help those networks avoid overload by diverting traffic away from areas experiencing high levels of congestion,‚Äù a statement quotes Dr Tom Leighton, the CEO and Co-Founder of Akamai.In regions where demand is creating bottlenecks for customers, Akamai will be reducing gaming software downloads at peak times, and completing the downloads at the normal fast speeds late at night. The approach, it says, will ensure that while gamers can still get their downloads, health workers will not face any issues with the digital services that are vital.Another consequence of the lockdowns is more usage of VPN or Virtual Private Networks, which can help users access websites or content which might not be allowed in their country. According to ExpressVPN, it has seen an increase of 21 per cent in the average global usage of its service since the end of February. In India, there‚Äôs been a growth of 15 per cent in VPN usage.‚ÄúWe are seeing strong demand in our services as more people spend more time indoors and employees around the world telework,‚Äù says a statement from Harold Li, vice president, ExpressVPN.But how long will the strain on the networks continue? The Ookla co-founder gives the example of China and how the situation played out there, where the coronavirus outbreak began and was followed by a lockdown in Wuhan.‚ÄúSix weeks ago, China looked like the other parts of the world do now, where everyone shifted to working from home. There were a lot of slowdowns on the internet. It took five to six weeks for things to return to normal there. But as of the last two weeks, it looks like it used to before,‚Äù he points out.In his view, if the lockdowns and social distancing measures are adhered to, and everyone does stay home, it would take a month or so for internet speeds to get back to normal, though he cautions, it will depend on the number of people actually staying at home.üì£ The Indian Express is now on Telegram.

https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/gaming/apples-app-store-rules-limit-rival-gaming-services-while-arcade-runs-free-6331291/,Apple‚Äôs App Store rules limit rival gaming services while Arcade runs free,2020-03-25 17:40:04+05:30,"Video-game fans suddenly have their pick of a huge menu of titles thanks to a raft of new mobile subscription services from Apple Inc, Microsoft Corp, Alphabet Inc‚Äôs Google and Nvidia Corp. But for the more than 1 billion users of Apple‚Äôs iPhone and iPad, the only real option is Arcade, the subscription service launched by the company in September.That‚Äôs because Apple imposes strict limits on the kinds of apps users can access on its devices. For example, App Store guidelines ban services that rely on streaming from the cloud. Arcade adheres to the requirements, in part, because it‚Äôs included as a feature within the App Store itself. This is the latest example of what critics say are arbitrary rules favoring Apple‚Äôs own apps at the expense of similar software from outside developers.‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a fraught relationship between developers and Apple precisely because of rules like this,‚Äù said David Barnard, a longtime independent developer and advocate at RevenueCat. ‚ÄúIn some ways, I am incredibly grateful to their marketplace for helping me make millions of dollars I wouldn‚Äôt have made without it. On the flip side, them being so heavy handed at times does kill apps and does cause developers to miss out on other potential revenue.‚ÄùIf software developers want to reach as many consumers as possible, they have to be on Apple‚Äôs iOS. The operating system powers more than 1 billion smartphones and tablets and it‚Äôs the only way to access the iOS App Store, which accounted for 65 per cent of app spending globally last year, according to Sensor Tower. The Cupertino, California-based company can also make or break mobile gaming businesses: More than half of the $62 billion spent on smartphone gaming last year happened on Apple products.Cloud gaming services, where users stream games live over the internet, are growing in popularity, especially as faster fifth-generation, or 5G, wireless networks proliferate. The new offerings from Microsoft, Nvidia and Google are cloud streaming-based, while Apple Arcade is not. Those other services are found on the Android operating system, which powers 2.5 billion devices worldwide. Among the popular games found there, and missing from iOS, are Red Dead Redemption 2, Gears of War 5 and Destiny 2.Asked about the challenge of reaching iPhone and iPad users with the chipmaker‚Äôs GeForce Now service, an Nvidia spokesperson said: ‚ÄúAsk Apple.‚ÄùApple said its ‚Äúcustomers enjoy great apps and games from millions of developers and gaming services can absolutely launch on the App Store‚Äù if they follow the App Review Guidelines, which means that games have to be submitted individually, allowing them to appear in App Store rankings and search. The company also said it intends to continue building on its relationships with developers and providing a level playing field.‚ÄúDevelopers can choose to reach all iPhone and iPad users over the web through Safari and other browsers on the App Store,‚Äù Apple said. But currently the new cloud-based gaming streaming services aren‚Äôt accessible through web browsers on iPhones and iPads.Whether the restrictions raise antitrust issues is another matter. The policies were in place before the latest gaming services launched, and ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt see it cutting one way or the other,‚Äù said David Reichenberg, an antitrust lawyer at Cozen O‚ÄôConnor.Apple said there is strong competition in every category in which it makes its own apps. Arcade, only available on iOS, is $4.99 per month for more than 100 games and is a growing contributor to the company‚Äôs services revenue, which is important amid a period of reduced hardware sales growth.At least one gaming subscription offering, GameClub, has managed to get on the App Store. It licensed several old-school games, released them all on the App Store as separate apps under one developer account and offers one $4.99 subscription that works across the apps. Still, it was rejected 127 times by Apple before being approved. ‚ÄúThe amount of effort we put into making sure the app played by Apple‚Äôs rules was no joke, it was a huge undertaking,‚Äù Eli Hodapp, GameClub‚Äôs head of business development, said.In February, Microsoft released a beta version of its gaming service, currently dubbed xCloud. It is still in free preview, but is expected to launch later this year as a paid service under the company‚Äôs Game Pass brand. A look at the software shows the contortions that it and other Arcade rivals will have to pull off to get on Apple‚Äôs system. While Microsoft‚Äôs has a catalog of 90 games available on Android, just one, Halo, appears on the iPhone test version. Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft and Mountain View, California-based Google declined to comment.The Android variant of xCloud lets users choose from multiple games built by different publishers. A version of the app on iOS could only have games either developed or exclusively licensed by Microsoft.Apple outlines this in an App Store rule that says ‚Äúgames offered in a game subscription must be owned or exclusively licensed by the developer.‚Äù For example, Microsoft‚Äôs iOS service can offer Halo because Microsoft produces that game, but not Ace Combat from Bandai Namco.This restriction prevents game developers from being able to work with game partners already on other platforms. Apple said Arcade complies with all the guidelines. Microsoft makes several of its own games, but Google and Nvidia would only be able to launch if they exclusively licensed third-party titles. Google‚Äôs Stadia costs $9.99 per month and new games are added monthly. Nvidia offers free and $4.99 per month subscription tiers, but requires a user to login to a Valve Steam account to access many titles.A related guideline bans the subscription services from carrying over upgrades like levels, extra weapons and characters unless they are also available as an in-app purchase in the App Store. Like many other apps, this gives Apple a 30 per cent cut of revenue from developers, while confusing users who play video games on multiple platforms. It also means more overhead for developers.If a developer is able to build or license enough games for a service, they would still be prohibited from releasing an all-you-can-eat gaming subscription service on iOS that works inside of a single app.Many games are available to be downloaded individually from their creators, but consumers increasingly like to subscribe to a bundle of games at a lower monthly price ‚Äî much like they‚Äôd subscribe to Apple Music instead of downloading individual songs or sign up for Netflix instead of buying specific movies.The same rule that bars non-exclusive titles requires that ‚Äúeach game must be downloaded directly from the App Store.‚Äù This means an app can‚Äôt include a catalog of games and must be broken up into separate apps. Apple said the guideline is to prevent games from being added or removed without review. Apple allows catalog apps for magazines, newspapers, music, videos and books.‚ÄúThe App Store was created to be a safe and trusted place for customers to discover and download apps, and a great business opportunity for all developers,‚Äù Apple said. ‚ÄúBefore they go on our store, all apps are reviewed against the same set of guidelines that are intended to protect customers and provide a fair and level playing field to developers.‚ÄùWhile a game developer could feasibly workaround the first few games-related guidelines, Apple‚Äôs decision to block games that stream directly from the cloud is an iOS deal-killer for Microsoft‚Äôs xCloud, Google‚Äôs Stadia and Nvidia‚Äôs GeForce NOW.Apple‚Äôs rules state that ‚Äúthin clients for cloud-based apps are not appropriate for the App Store.‚Äù This type of app does little on the device, with most of the action offloaded to remote data centers, much like how Netflix streams movies. In contrast, each Apple Arcade game runs fully on the device without the need to stream data from the cloud.Cloud streaming works on an early test version of Microsoft‚Äôs app, but if a full app like that was submitted to the Apple App Store it would probably be rejected. Microsoft‚Äôs beta app is available currently to 10,000 users through an Apple testing service called TestFlight, which traditionally follows the same rules as the App Store.Apple says that developers that publish games on the App Store benefit from features like Siri, backups and App Store promotion. Having to build a service without cloud streaming would be a lot more work for traditional game developers and would mean they have to re-create their apps for each platform rather than leverage their existing game libraries.Apple lets devlopers use a technology called remote desktop. This is similar to cloud streaming, but instead of piping in content from a data center, the game is streamed from a Mac, Windows computer, or gaming console. This method comes with a major caveat: users can only stream from a computer or console that they own and the iPhone must be on the same network as the first device. That means you can stream a game in your living room, but not on the bus to work.That has allowed apps like Sony‚Äôs PS4 Remote Play and Valve Steam Link. Microsoft xCloud for Android has a similar option for streaming from an Xbox, but the feature is missing from the iPhone. It‚Äôs unclear why Microsoft didn‚Äôt include it.Major technology companies aren‚Äôt the only ones having trouble getting on the App Store. For months, one app from Shadow, a Paris-based cloud gaming developer, appeared to survive Apple‚Äôs rules. That changed at the end of February when Shadow‚Äôs platform was removed. Shadow relied on streaming games from PCs in a server farm, versus computers owned by users. Shadow said it‚Äôs talking to Apple about getting back on the App Store.

https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/social/facebook-is-just-trying-to-keep-the-lights-on-as-traffic-soars-in-pandemic-6331205/,Facebook is ‚Äòjust trying to keep the lights on‚Äô as traffic soars in pandemic,2020-03-25 20:32:57+05:30,"As the coronavirus spread around the world and people everywhere were ordered to stay home, phone calls over Facebook‚Äôs apps more than doubled. In many countries, messaging on Instagram and Facebook soared by more than 50%, while group calls in Italy jumped by more than 1,000%. And hungry for information, people clicked repeatedly on virus news stories shown by the social network.Inside Facebook, that meant the pressure was on.‚ÄúWe‚Äôre just trying to keep the lights on over here,‚Äù Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook‚Äôs chief executive, said in an interview last week.As airlines, hotels, restaurants and other companies struggle to stay afloat during the pandemic, Facebook is also laboring to cope with the fallout. But unlike those other businesses, the Silicon Valley giant is being strained by the coronavirus in a different way: Its usage is going through the roof.Skyrocketing traffic and a crush of new users are now stressing Facebook‚Äôs systems just as its 45,000 employees are dealing with working remotely for the first time. The company is also trying to keep its users‚Äô data secure while employees who sift through posts to moderate content do so from home. At the same time, Facebook has added to its workload by promising to do more to limit virus misinformation.It is a pressure test moment for Facebook, which has for years grappled with a backlash over privacy and toxic content, but now has a chance to change that narrative and be seen as an essential communications and information tool during the outbreak.‚ÄúThe usage growth from COVID-19 is unprecedented across the industry, and we are experiencing new records in usage almost every day,‚Äù Alex Schultz and Jay Parikh, two Facebook vice presidents working on infrastructure, said in a blog post on Tuesday. ‚ÄúMaintaining stability throughout these spikes in usage is more challenging than usual now that most of our employees are working from home.‚ÄùWhat has saved Facebook‚Äôs network from crashing altogether, Zuckerberg said, was that the virus and the quarantines have had the largest impact in just a few areas where Facebook operates. Facebook is banned in China, where the virus first appeared, for instance.Those areas that have the highest concentration of people using Facebook‚Äôs services during peak hours from home are also spread out by time zone, Zuckerberg said, which staggers the swell of traffic.‚ÄúIt really is a big technical challenge,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre basically trying to ready everything we can.‚Äù He said Facebook had mobilized its engineers to make sure the company has enough computing capacity and adequate support to handle the surges.The strain has been compounded by Facebook‚Äôs workforce adapting to working from home, which had been discouraged in the past.The company‚Äôs executives have long preached internally that face-to-face meetings and in-person collaboration were central to Facebook‚Äôs success. The importance of in-person conversation was so great that employees at offices from Singapore to New York were frequently asked to travel to the company‚Äôs headquarters in Menlo Park, California, for quarterly meetings.That has made the transition to working from home especially difficult, said four Facebook employees who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly.To communicate, Facebook employees were told to use BlueJeans, which provides technology for videoconferencing calls, they said. But they quickly found that calls were frozen, or the video quality so bad that it was hard to make out who was speaking. Many employees instead turned to Apple‚Äôs FaceTime feature, Google video hangouts or Zoom conference calls. Some even built their own version of a video conference call, according to two employees.Issues quickly piled up.Two days into working from home, some Facebook managers sent the engineering teams a message: limit idle chat on work message boards.Facebook employees had been posting on those boards at a record rate, according to one employee. While some workers were sharing tips and best practices of how to set up a home office, others were sharing links to buy heirloom seeds for at-home farming, and instructions on how to sew their own face masks, one employee said.Other snafus surfaced.Last week, a bug within Facebook‚Äôs system began marking thousands of posts by major news outlets like Politico and The Sydney Morning Herald as spam, which resulted in the removal of the posts. It took Facebook a day to correct the mistake, as engineers struggled to communicate remotely with one another over how the bug had been introduced and what it would take to fix it.While they scrambled, rumors spread among Facebook‚Äôs users over the source of the bug, with many accusing the company of censoring people‚Äôs speech. Internally, Facebook managers said that while the bug was routine, the amount of time it took to fix it was not.‚ÄúThis was just a technical error, and we‚Äôre still doing the post-mortem to understand what happened so we can operationalize any learnings from that,‚Äù Zuckerberg said last week.Working from home has also made moderating Facebook‚Äôs posts more difficult. This month, Facebook put its army of global contractors from outside agencies on paid leave. Those contractors, who number more than 15,000, are responsible for sorting through the posts, images and videos that flow through Facebook‚Äôs services on a daily basis to weed out sensitive, explicit or hateful material.As the outbreak spread, contractors were ordered not to come into the office, where they worked on protected networks behind virtual firewalls to maintain user privacy. Many of those contractors do not have the same technology setup at home.Facebook is still trying to figure out how to let the contractors continue working. For now, it is relying on full-time employees, who do not have the training or the time, to moderate the posts themselves.Given that, Facebook employees have been asked to remove only the most sensitive, fringe posts, said one employee. The company also told employees that it would rely more heavily on their artificial intelligence systems to flag and remove posts.‚ÄúI do think it‚Äôs reasonable to expect that for some of the other categories where the severity might not be as imminent or extreme, that we may be a little less effective in the near term while we‚Äôre adjusting to this,‚Äù Zuckerberg said.While Facebook‚Äôs usage is soaring, that may not translate into financial gains. Most of the increase in traffic has occurred on the company‚Äôs messaging services ‚Äî like WhatsApp and Messenger ‚Äî which bring in relatively little revenue. And though more people are using the main News Feed and Facebook Stories in the core app, the company said it wasn‚Äôt immune to a wider pullback in advertising.‚ÄúOur business is being adversely affected like so many others around the world,‚Äù Schultz and Parikh said in the blog post. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve seen a weakening in our ads business in countries taking aggressive actions to reduce the spread of COVID-19.‚ÄùZuckerberg said Facebook was doing what it could to prepare for the weeks ahead, as it doesn‚Äôt anticipate the issues to abate anytime soon.‚ÄúI‚Äôve never seen anything like this before,‚Äù he said.üì£ The Indian Express is now on Telegram.

According to a new study, these naturally occurring superconducting materials were found embedded inside two distinct meteorites that crash-landed on Earth.Superconductors are important for humans as the material can conduct electrical current without resistance. The material ensures ‚Äòperfect‚Äô conductivity and finds use in a lot of areas. Even though the superconductor inside the Australian meteorite is a known material, its discovery in space debris comes as a shock.Meteorites have been known to deliver minerals to Earth that we have never seen before as well as materials that are older than our Solar System itself. However, this is the first time meteorites crash-landed on Earth with embedded superconductive grains.Also Read | Earth‚Äôs mini-moon left the planet‚Äôs orbit, but there will be more to comeResearchers from UC San Diego investigated fragments from 15 different meteorites using magnetic field modulated microwave spectroscopy to detect traces of superconductivity inside samples.

The other one is a rare¬†ureilite¬†meteorite¬†GRA 95205 which was located in Antarctica a quarter-century ago.The study is published in the PNAS or Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America. According to the research, measurements and analysis identified alloys of lead, indium, and tin in the meteorite sample which were not previously found in space debris.‚ÄúEven the simplest superconducting mineral, lead, is only rarely found naturally in its native form, and, to our knowledge, there are no previous reports of natural lead samples superconducting,‚Äù the authors¬†explain in their paper.Express Tech is now on¬†Telegram.

https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/opinion-technology/realme-blog-narzo-10-10a-launch-amid-coronavirus-pandemic-india-lockdown-6330648/,"The Realme Blog: The Narzo series is coming, but is this a good time? [Updated]",2020-03-25 11:08:20+05:30,"Recently Realme posted a video on its social media channels and everyone thought the company is releasing a music video or something. But no, it was the promo video of a new smartphone series called Narzo. Wait, what? Narzo? What does that even mean? Well, Realme is yet to reveal the mystery behind the name, but it does say that this series is for Generation Z aka the youth.It‚Äôs great that the company is trying different strategies to attract consumers but I feel it is a bad time to launch a smartphone in India given companies are being affected by the closure of manufacturing units and workers unable to come to work.The Narzo smartphone series was said to launch in India on March 26 but it has now been delayed due to 21-day pan India lockdown. Realme is yet to confirm the new launch date.It was supposed to be a recorded launch video as most employees are working from home. However, all this was before Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced a 21-day pan-India lockdown. Most companies have postponed their scheduled launch events to April.Here‚Äôs everything we know about Realme Narzo smartphone seriesRealme has also suspended its manufacturing operations in Greater Noida, Uttar Pradesh from March 21, 2020 due to coronavirus pandemic. The brand also said that COVID-19 will temporarily affect the inventory and supply in the market for some time. This could not just impact the sales of the Narzo series but also all other recently launched Realme phones.With Realme Narzo the company wants to be more than just a camera phone, given that has been its key focus for (almost) all its recently launched phones. It has revealed that both the Narzo 10 and Narzo 10 A will come with a powerful processor, impressive screen, big 5000mAh battery paired with fast charging support. Teasers have confirmed that the Narzo 10 will include four cameras at the back while there 10A will sport three of them.I feel the Realme Narzo series will take a different approach as far as the design is concerned. The teasers show that the Narzo 10 with quad cameras will sport Realme X special garlic and ginger edition like design with vertical lines throughout the rear panel of the phone. I had used the Realme X ginger edition for some time when it was launched last year and feel it‚Äôs still the best-designed Realme phone so far.What is Narzo? What does it mean?The Narzo 10A on the other hand sports a similar design as the Realme power bank with a huge vertically placed logo throughout the back cover. It looks different and unique from other phones from the company.It is still unclear why Realme is bringing a separate smartphone series in India given the market is already flooded with Realme number series, C series U series, Pro series, X series, and X Pro series phones.Note: After this blog was posted Realme informed us that the Narzo series launch has been delayed due to India lockdown. The new launch date hasn‚Äôt been revealed as yet.¬†Work from Home appears to be the norm for many of us. We at Indian Express tech have some articles which could help make this easier.

https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/techook/xiaomi-redmi-k30-pro-vs-poco-x2-6329450/,Redmi K30 Pro vs Poco X2: Which one is better?,2020-03-25 10:19:57+05:30,"Redmi K30 Pro is now official in China, and is the successor to last year‚Äôs Redmi K20 Pro. The K series under the Redmi brand offers flagship-like specifications, but at a more reasonable price, and this is a trend that has continued with the K30 phones as well. So it is not surprising the Redmi K30 Pro runs the Qualcomm Snapdragon 865 processor, which is the high-end variant for this year.While the Redmi K20 series was launched in India, the K30 series has not yet made an appearance, unless you count the Poco X2. That‚Äôs because the Poco X2 is essentially the re-branded version of the Redmi K30 in the Indian market, and it is quite an affordable phone for what it offers.There‚Äôs no word on whether Redmi K30 Pro will come to India and whether it will have a different name. But the new Redmi phone does raise some interest given what it offers. There‚Äôs also the question of how does the new Redmi K30 Pro phone compare to the previous phone.¬† Given the Poco X2 has the same specifications as the Redmi K30, we are comparing it to the new Redmi K30 Pro. Here‚Äôs a look at the specifications, features of the two phones.Redmi K30 Pro has been launched at Yuan 2,999 (approximately Rs 32,260) for the 6GB RAM/64GB storage variant, at Yuan 3,399 (approximately Rs 36,560) for the 8GB RAM/128GB storage variant and at Yuan 3,699 (approximately Rs 39,770) for the 8GB RAM/256GB storage variant.Express Tech is now on Telegram. Click here to join our channel (@expresstechie) and stay updated with the latest tech newsThe Poco X2 is comparatively much cheaper at Rs 15,999 for the 6GB RAM/64GB storage, Rs 16,999 for the 6GB RAM/128GB storage variant and Rs 19,999 for the 8GB RAM/256GB storage variant.The Redmi K30 Pro is being offered in Moonlight White, Sky Blue, Purple and Space Grey colour options. And the Poco X2 comes in Atlantis Blue, Matrix Purple and Phoenix Red colour options.Both the Poco X2 and the Redmi K30 Pro sport a glass back panel held together by a metal frame. Poco X2 comes with a p2i Splash-Proof coating, which makes it water repellant, however, the Redmi K30 Pro comes with a proper IP53 dust and water resistance rating.Also Read:¬†Poco X2, Redmi K20, Realme X2: These are best phones under Rs 20,000 right nowRedmi K30 Pro comes with an in-display fingerprint scanner, while the Poco X2 features a side-mounted one just like the Samsung Galaxy S10e.¬† Both the devices sport a circular looking camera module trying to mimic the Huawei Mate 30 Pro‚Äôs back camera. But based on the visuals, the Redmi K30 Pro‚Äôs camera looks better.One major differentiator between the two phones is that the Poco X2 has a pill-shaped cut-out to accommodate the front cameras, while the Redmi K30 Pro sports a motorised pop-up selfie camera. One advantage is that pop-up selfie camera does not hinder any content that you are viewing and ensures the true edge-to-edge display experience.Poco X2 does not have a proper pill-shaped cut-out, rather it has two separate holes joined by pixels that have been turned off using the software. This causes the Poco X2 to have a shadow effect near the cut-out.Also Read:¬†Realme 6 Pro vs Poco X2: Which mid-range should you buy?Redmi K30 Pro sports a 6.67-inch Super AMOLED display with HDR10+ support and has a 92.7 screen-to-body ratio. It comes with a 60Hz refresh rate panel according to various reports, however, Xiaomi is yet to comment on that. The device has a 180Hz touch sampling rate, which would make the display capable of at least 90Hz. However, Xiaomi could be holding this back due to software issues and might enable it at a later point with the help of an update.Poco X2 also comes with a 6.67-inch display. However, it uses IPS LCD technology instead of AMOLED technology. Where the Poco X2 pulls ahead is that it comes with a 120Hz refresh rate display. This would make the viewing experience better on the Poco X2, due to the smoothness of the display. It also enhances the gaming performance as there is minimal screen tearing while playing high frame rate games.Also Read:¬†What is Realme Narzo? Is it Realme‚Äôs answer to Redmi, Poco?Redmi K30 Pro comes with Qualcomm‚Äôs flagship Snapdragon 865 processor and comes with what Xiaomi calls as the ‚Äòlargest vapour chamber liquid cooling system.‚Äô¬† ¬†The Poco X2, on the other hand,¬† uses the Qualcomm Snapdragon 730G processor. The processor is good and can handle heavy gaming quite well, making it a good phone. But given the Redmi K30 Pro‚Äôs flagship processor, it will obviously show better results.The Redmi K30 Pro comes with a quad camera setup on the back, which consists of a 64MP Sony IMX686 primary sensor paired with a 13MP ultra-wide-angle lens, an 8MP telephoto lens and a 5MP depth sensor. The camera supports taking images in HEIF and RAW formats, They also support 8K video recording. On the front, it sports a 20MP motorised pop-up selfie camera, just like its predecessor the Redmi K20 Pro.Poco X2 also comes with a 64MP quad-camera setup on the back. This consists of a 64MP primary sensor, an 8MP ultra-wide-angle sensor, a 2MP depth sensor and a 2MP macro sensor. On the front, it has a dual camera setup consisting of a 20MP primary sensor paired with a 2MP depth sensor.Also Read:¬†Confused between Realme 6 and Redmi Note 9 Pro?

The coronavirus outbreak and subsequent lockdown means more people are working from home. Add to that schools are also closed and with children at home the end result is that a lot more data is being consumed whether for work or for entertainment purposes.Especially for those with children at home, streaming apps or services like YouTube, Hotstar, Netflix, Amazon Prime Video can all act like solid data guzzlers. Already Netflix, Amazon Prime Video have announced they will be reducing streaming quality in Europe, America.But there are settings in each of these apps to ensure that you can optimise your data consumption. We explain how to keep a track for some of the popular streaming services.The good thing about Netflix is that they give out comprehensive details on how much data is consumed based on the settings.¬†According to the help page, watching shows or movies on the streaming service will see the consumption of around 1GB of data per hour at standard definition or 720p. For HD video, this jumps up to 3GB of data per hour. The page also notes that ‚Äúdownloading and streaming consume a similar amount of data.‚ÄùSo how can you reduce some data usage on Netflix? Well, the service has four options for data usage. There‚Äôs low which consumes 0.3 GB per hour per device, followed by medium or SD, which comes to 0.7 GB per hour per device and high which consumes around 3GB per hour. The highest is the Ultra HD or 4K which consumes 7 GB per hour per device.Must read: From Kerala, a robot to take care of coronavirus patientsKeep in mind that the data usage settings only apply to the one Netflix profile.

Higher will use more storage when you download content.¬† Netflix says users will not be able to change this setting if they have any pending downloads. Cancel them, and then try again or wait for them to finish.With automatic settings for mobile data usage, Netflix does around 4 hours of streaming per GB of data. The save data setting, brings down consumption per GB to around six hours of streaming on Netflix. The maximum data setting streams at the highest possible level and uses nearly one GB per 20 minutes or more. It would be best to change it if this is the level right now on your devices.Amazon Prime Video also lists out the amount of data used when streaming at different quality options. The service uses around 0.38GB data per hour with a good quality setting, for better it rises to 1.48GB per hour. The best quality setting consumes nearly 6.84 GB per hour.

WhatsApp has partnered with the World Health Organisation and the Indian government to launch two chatbots in order to provide authentic information about the coronavirus.The MyGov Corona Help Desk chatbot for the Indian WhatsApp user has been developed by Jio Haptik Technologies Limited and powered by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare together with the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology.The chatbot developed by WHO provides global information regarding the COViD-19 outbreak and is simply known as the ‚ÄúWorld Health Organization‚Äù.The MyGov Corona Helpdesk can be accessed by adding +91-9013-151515 to your contacts and sending a message or by following this link: wa.me/919013151515. The WHO chatbot can be accessed by adding +41-7989-31892 to your contacts and sending a message or by following this link: bit.ly/who-covid19-whatsapp. I tried both of these chatbots and here is what I found:The MyGov chatbot introduces itself as ‚Äúthe Government of India‚Äôs Coronavirus (COVID-19) Helpdesk to create awareness and help you and your family stay safe‚Äù and straight up shares the emergency helpline number and email address for the Indian users.The chatbot has six options in total:1. Latest Update on Coronavirus in India
2. What is Coronavirus and what are its symptoms?
3. How does Coronavirus spread?
4. How to reduce the risk of Coronavirus?
5. Professional advice by AIIMS-Director
6. Where to get help?Users need to reply with the number written against a query to make the selection.When I pressed 1, the chatbot informed me about the confirmed cases of coronavirus in the country along with active cases, cured or discharged cases, and the number of deaths by COVID-19. However, the information with chatbot does not refresh too often. Even at 3:45 pm in the evening, it continued to show stats from 10:30 am in the morning.In the same message, the MyGov Corona Helpdesk shared the number of testing facilities in the country, along with a link to a document containing state and district wise details of COVID-19 cases. It also had links to the MyGov website and MOHFW website.The response from the chatbot also carried the latest announcement made by the government related to the coronavirus outbreak. In the morning, it shared the lockdown announcement and around 3 pm, it shared information about the Prime Minister‚Äôs address to the nation scheduled at 8 pm.For other responses, the chatbot presented useful information regarding symptoms, spread of disease, and health tips with the help of YouTube videos, graphical pamphlets, and more. It also shared links to videos by Director, AIIMS-Delhi to learn and clear doubts on coronavirus. This can be particularly useful given so many fake videos of ‚Äòdoctors‚Äô are being shared on WhatsApp.If you press 6, the chatbot shares helpline numbers again with an option to view state-wise helpline numbers.The MyGov chatbot and WHO chatbot are not that different, but the latter is aimed at a much wider audience. It presents users with eight options and users need to send the number written before a query to get the information.The WHO chatbot gives you ‚Äúlatest numbers‚Äù of coronavirus patients from around the world as well as new cases reported in the last 24 hours. You can also check country numbers by tapping on the link shared by the chatbot. The chatbot also lists out COVID-19 symptoms together with advisories to ‚Äúprotect yourself‚Äù.It also shares ‚Äúmyth-busters‚Äù as well as ‚Äútravel advice‚Äù. I would urge readers to see these myth-busters in particular, and share them on WhatsApp considering this is authenticated information.With WHO chatbot, users can get the latest news updates shared by the WHO with just a tap. My favourite part of this chatbot was the third option‚Äî ‚ÄúYour questions answered‚Äù. Once you complete all the question-answers, you will feel like an expert on the subject leaving no doubt for any confusion. These reponses cover all aspects of the coronavirus (SARS-Cov-2) and the COVID-19 disease.Express Tech is now on Telegram.

The target amount is $10 million and you can contribute to help WHO-led effort to respond to the pandemic.The coronavirus pandemic has claimed more than 17,000 lives globally, affecting more than 3.8 lakh people.

A few weeks ago Jio, Vodafone and Airtel added a dedicated caller tune on all numbers to spread COVID-19 awareness message among the citizens of India. The caller tune mentions the symptoms of coronavirus and preventive measures one can take.With COVID-19 cases significantly rising in India Jio has now added a ‚Äúsymptoms checker‚Äù option on its MyJio application.

Do you have cold? and many more.After answering all these questions correctly the symptoms checker shows the result for the risk of getting COVID-19. For us, it showed ‚ÄúLow Risk‚Äù.

https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/from-kerala-a-robot-to-take-care-of-coronavirus-patients-6329400/,"From Kerala, a robot to take care of coronavirus patients",2020-03-25 06:48:07+05:30,"As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to spread in India and across the world, Kochi-based startup Asimov Robotics has developed a robot that can be deployed in hospitals to ease pressure on the medical staff. The three-wheeled robot can carry food, medical and clinical consumables and navigate freely in the hospitals. The robot has been developed in 15 days by a team of seven people.‚ÄúIt is impractical to deploy human-like robots in hospitals. This is why we are working on a cost-effective model which is very practical at this point,‚Äù Jayakrishnan T, CEO of Asimov Robotics told indianexpress.com on phone.Jayakrishnan said the robot is mainly designed to be used inside isolation wards. The robot, dubbed ‚ÄúKARMI-BOT‚Äù, has lower and upper trays that can be loaded with food or sterile containers. Additionally, the robot also disinfects the used items as it comes out of the quarantine zone. The robot also lets doctors or relatives interact with the patients through video calling.Jayakrishnan said the robot has autonomous navigation and can be used remotely as well. The advantage of deploying a robot in this scenario is to cut down on human to human contact. This will help both health workers and visitors.Express Tech is now on Telegram. Click here to join our channel (@expresstechnology) and stay updated with the latest tech newsThe robot is currently being tested internally and fine-tuned at the lab. ‚ÄúIf spares are ready, we can make one robot per day with the current facility itself,‚Äù he said.Jayakrishnan said the interest in the robot is increasing, even though the product has not been out yet. The company has been talking to clients in the US and the Middle East. However, Jayakrishnan is aware that to meet the demand, the firm needs to set up a production line and expand the facility which may take some lead time. For now, though the company wants to focus on the domestic market and its home state.Jayakrishnan declined to reveal how much it costs to make the KARMI-BOT, but said it will be cheaper to produce than the existing robots. ‚Äú US clients are specifically interested in non-Chinese products, which is an advantage for us. Our ultimate aim is to load it with features and bring the cost below Chinese competitors,‚Äù he said.Asimov Robotics, which is incubated within the Kerala Startup Mission, is one of the few high-tech robotics companies from India that focuses on healthcare.‚ÄúOur robots are connected and not standalone products. The robots are connected to the distributed sensor network and use AI and MI to come to a decision and based on that decision, they respond,‚Äù he explains.In China, many hospitals have deployed high-tech robots to deliver food to patients, take patients‚Äô temperatures, deliver medication and disinfect the facility. Similarly, the Spanish government is planning to test 80,000 patients a day using robots in a bid to fight the pandemic.Earlier this month, Jayakrishnan and his team deployed two humanoid robots at the entrance of Maker Village at the Kinfra Hi-Tech Park in Kalamassery to create awareness about the coronavirus outbreak and distribute masks and sanitisers to people who work in the Integrated Startup Complex.Jayakrishnan is also working on a realistic humanoid robot similar to Sophia. The robot, called Chhaya, is able to converse, understand and synthesise expressions.üì£ The Indian Express is now on Telegram.

Due to this internet consumption has gone up drastically given people are either playing games or watching movies or making video calls with friends and family members living far away. People are also depending a lot on OTT platforms for entertainment.Streaming services like Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, and some others have reduced their video quality in order to offer a smooth viewing experience at least during the lockdown period.

Called the COVID-19 CTI League, for cyber threat intelligence, the group spans more than 40 countries and includes professionals in senior positions at such major companies as Microsoft Corp and Amazon.com Inc.One of four initial managers of the effort, Marc Rogers, said the top priority would be working to combat hacks against medical facilities and other frontline responders to the pandemic. It is already working on hacks of health organizations. Also key is the defence of communication networks and services that have become essential as more people work from home, said Rogers, head of security at the long-running hacking conference Def Con and a vice president at security company Okta Inc.The group is also using its web of contacts in internet infrastructure providers to squash garden-variety phishing attacks and another financial crime that is using the fear of COVID-19 or the desire for information on it to trick regular internet users.‚ÄúI‚Äôve never seen this volume of phishing,‚Äù Rogers said. ‚ÄúI am literally seeing phishing messages in every language known to man.‚ÄùPhishing messages try to induce recipients to enter passwords or other sensitive information on websites controlled by the attackers, who then use the data to take control of bank, email or other accounts. Rogers said the group had already dismantled one campaign that used a software vulnerability to spread malicious software. He declined to provide details, and said that in general the group would be reluctant to reveal what it was fighting.Rogers said law enforcement had been surprisingly welcoming of the collaboration, recognising the vastness of the threat. Rogers is a UK citizen based in the San Francisco Bay Area. Two other group coordinators are American, and one is Israeli.‚ÄúI have never seen this level of cooperation,‚Äù Rogers said. ‚ÄúI hope it continues afterwards, because it‚Äôs a beautiful thing to see.‚Äùüì£ The Indian Express is now on Telegram.

The candidates have been preparing for the exam amidst the 21 days lockdown in their homes taking online classroom sessions and online test series. However, fraudsters are equally active in this period trying very hard to trick the aspirants and steal money.UPSC CSE candidates often receive promotional messages from coaching institutes marketing their preparation material and fraudsters also ride along with similar messages. But this time, cybercriminals are sending alerts to aspirants regarding ‚Äúimportant notification released due to Novel Coronavirus‚Äù with a link. We checked the link and here‚Äôs what we found.The URL takes you to a website where there is no such notification but an advertisement for test series. ‚ÄúDue to COVID-19 all students Please stay home. Our Expert Team Specially Designed Tests and study material. For all UPSC CSE 2020 aspirant [sic].‚ÄùThe website mentions that their test series is designed by ‚Äúprofessor from top university due to COVID-19‚Äù in order to help poor students. Usually, the price of IAS (Prelims + Mains) test series is priced at Rs 40,000 but the website claims to offer the test-series for as little as Rs 699, which is also refundable within 48 hours.The website also claims to offer free Netflix subscription ‚Äúdue to COVID-19‚Äù.With just a simple look at the website and its grammatically incorrect sentences makes it clear that this isn‚Äôt a legit website but is a scam. However, the domain ‚Äúiitmadras.online/upsc.html‚Äù ends up making it look authentic for some users ‚Äî especially to marginalised aspirants who don‚Äôt have enough money to enroll with a test-series program run by reputed coaching institutions. We dug deeper to find the truth of the site.According to who.is, the domain was registered on August 21, 2019 by one Rudra Pratap from Guntur, Andhra Pradesh and expires on August 21, 2020.Once you click on registration link on the web page, it takes you to another website wooe.in ‚Äî a fairly looking site claiming to offer test series for multiple competitive exams at a nominal fee with the promise of a refund. In my investigation, I found that the refund never really happens and the claims are false just to trick aspirants. Following are some screenshots of users who complained about the portal on Quora and consumercomplaints.in:I also discovered that to build its image as a genuine test series provider, Wooe has built a net of positive reviews around the internet including a long list of praises on Quora. Users who posted positive reviews of Wooe.in at Quora also claimed that it is run by IIT Madras.However, IIT Madras has denied its association with any such portal. Following is the notice issued by the IIT Madras:Wooe is not alone in running fake test-series or online coaching programs with prices too real to be true. Somehow, they get a hold of mobile numbers of government job aspirants and send them messages promoting their fake services. Unfortunately, lots of users fall for it and lose money.* If it‚Äôs too good to be true, it‚Äôs probably a scam. There is no way, a private organisation will provide Rs 40,000 worth of test series for Rs 699, that too with free Netflix subscription for a year.* If the message or website in question has grammar mistakes, it is probably fake that has been built in haste for the sole purpose of scamming people.* Look at the URL carefully. Most of these make-shift websites register a domain that gives it an impression of association with a reputed institute‚Äî in this case, IIT Madras. Check for the association. If IIT Madras would have been providing test series, you can find it with a simple Google Search. Also, if you just search IIT Madras, you will get to know that the institute‚Äôs URL is iitm.ac.in and not iitmadras.online.* Don‚Äôt trust random educational portals. Do your research before subscribing to any test-series or online course. In the case of Wooe, it is not easy to identify it based on its website alone but the cheap test-series amount should ring a bell in your head.Express Tech is now on¬†Telegram.

https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/mobile-tabs/before-razr-motorola-was-testing-tablet-style-foldable-phone-design-6332576/,"Before Razr, Motorola was testing tablet-style foldable phone design",2020-03-26 15:11:01+05:30,"Motorola‚Äôs original foldable device was a tablet-style phone, before it finalised the design of the new Razr. However, the company felt such a device was too large and thus veered in favour of a more compact, flip-style form factor.‚ÄúWe tested multiple prototypes. We tested a tablet-style too, but we wanted to have an ultra-compact design,‚Äù Prashanth Mani, Country Head, Lenovo Mobile Business Group and MD, Motorola Mobility, India, told indianexpress.com in a telephonic interview.The new Razr is a reboot of the iconic Razr flip phone from 2004. The revamped version, however, is a modern Android smartphone with a screen that measures 6.2-inch diagonal but folds in half. When fully closed, the device easily slips into a pocket.Motorola was first to launch the Razr foldable phone with a clamshell design late last year and soon Samsung followed with the Galaxy Z Flip. The Galaxy Z Flip too has a flip phone-style form factor but features a foldable glass screen and is cheaper than the Razr.Without getting into comparisons, Mani said both foldable phones have pros and cons. ‚ÄúI think both devices have their own uniqueness in this category,‚Äù he said.Like in the case of the Razr, the phone has a secondary 2.7-inch OLED screen on the outside of the clamshell for notifications when the phone is closed. The Galaxy Z Flip, in contrast, has a tiny 1.1-inch pill-shaped external display that is limited in functionality. The Razr is impressively thin and the hinge that allows the phone to lay completely flat. But where the Galaxy Z Flip scores over the Razr is on the display front and internal hardware. The Galaxy Z Flip is also cheaper in comparison to the Razr.‚ÄúThe design defined Razr for us. In every decision point, the look and feel of the device were kept in mind. So we have succeeded in our view in creating a device that embodies our code philosophy, simplicity, surprise, and richness,‚Äù he explains. Mani said it took the company four years to design the Razr and the team worked closely with Lenovo‚Äôs laptop team to perfect the hinge.Neither the Razr nor the Galaxy Z Flip is perfect, but many critics have found that the Razr is less powerful in terms of specifications. Some even had a harsh opinion on the average camera performance.Mani has defended the company‚Äôs decision to go with the Snapdragon 710 processor and a single 16MP camera on the Razr that costs Rs 124,999. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not just about megapixel or megabytes. It‚Äôs also about what the design bodies, what kind of craftsmanship goes into it, and what kind of material is used. We believe that these are things that make a phone premium today,‚Äù he says. He said that as the price band goes up, the most important thing people consider in a phone is the design language and craftsmanship.Whether a consumer chooses the Razr or the Galaxy Z Flip, both phones have fascinating new technology that‚Äôs largely untested on a large scale, and these phones are expensive to manufacture. Despite the high price of the Razr, Mani believes there is a set of customers who would want to spend the money on a foldable phone. ‚ÄúThe market is big enough for foldable phones,‚Äù he said confidently.¬†The new Razr‚Äôs Rs 124,999 price includes 18 per cent GST, which has increased the cost of the device in India. Fluctuation in the exchange rate and local duties have further added to the retail price of the Razr. The phone has been made in China and not in India, where Motorola manufactures its other smartphones.Mani agrees that the foldable devices are in the early stages and it will take some time to see the growth in the category. ‚ÄúThe foldable itself is at a very nascent phase but we think the category will grow significantly over the next one or two years,‚Äù he said, adding that the company will continue to invest in the foldable tech and work with our partners to develop further functionalities on it.‚ÄùOne big feature the Razr lacks is the 5G connectivity. Although 5G networks are not going to be live in India this year, if you are going to spend Rs 124,999 on a phone, you might expect the feature to be there in the device. However, Mani said the company‚Äôs priority was to get the foldable phone right and 5G was not something Motorola aimed to add in the Razr.Motorola hasn‚Äôt announced a 5G smartphone yet, but the company is looking at this space closely. In fact, both foldables and 5G are important areas for Motorola in the coming years.Mani was tightlipped on the company‚Äôs next foldable phone, but he did say that the team is evaluating multiple designs and form factors. Virtually every smartphone maker is working on foldable smartphones and trying to perfect the technology.The new Razr, which was intended to go on sale from April 2 in India, could be delayed further due to the three-week pan-India lockdown. The country has been put under complete lockdown for 21 days in an aim to curtail the spread of coronavirus in the nation of 1.3 billion people. Flipkart, the exclusive online partner to sell the Razr, has temporarily suspended operations in view of the 21-day lockdown. The phone was also supposed to be available from the top 200 offline stores in India.üì£ The Indian Express is now on Telegram.

Apple, for instance, sells a device that also makes apps viewable on TV.Reluctance to share more data with Google could be a factor as well.Google said Chromecast usage rose in recent weeks versus a year ago and that the company continually encourages apps to adopt its free casting software.

This week we have seen competitors Xiaomi and Realme delay the launch of Mi 10 and Nazro 10 series as PM Narendra Modi announced 21-day lockdown in India. In the last month several tech companies have delayed their upcoming launches due to fears over COVID-19. Apple is said to join the list as the company might postpone the launch of its upcoming iPhone.A new report coming from Nikkei suggests that Apple is planning to delay the launch of 2020‚Äôs flagship iPhones. Recently the Cupertino major canceled the WWDC physical event and moved it to online only. WWDC will take place in May this year.Like every year, Apple was expected to launch the new iPhone aka the iPhone 12 series in the fall.

Everything clearly depends on the situation in the coming months.iPhone 12 Pro Max: What is Sensor-shift stabilization and how does it work?Supply chain constraints due to coronavirus could be one of the key reasons behind the delay in Apple keynote this year. Due to COVID-19 Apple has shut all factories as well as stores around the world. Apple manufacturing units in China are closed since last month when the pandemic hit the country majorly and the company couldn‚Äôt risk its worker‚Äôs health.READ: Apple may start reopening stores in first half of April‚ÄúSupply chain constraint aside, Apple is concerned that the current situation would significantly lower consumer appetite to upgrade their phones, which could lead to a tame reception of the first 5G iPhone,‚Äù Nikkei quotes a source close to the development.Apple is yet to talk about the launch delay as yet but given the on-going situation, the delay in iPhone 12 series launch is highly likely.

Plus India is in a 21-day lockdown. One easy and simple way to best some of this stress is to play video games. Studies show that video games also help us improve our response timings and cognitive thinking. Here we will be recommending a few games for you to play during all this free time, with no bar on the gaming product you own.Give most of are now dependent on our mobiles, let us first list out games you can play on the smartphone itself to keep the mind occupied. You can also check out our earlier list on the best games you can play while in self-quarantine.PUBG MobilePUBG Mobile is one of the most popular games across the globe on both iOS and Android. It is also a very easy game to get a hold off. I recommend that you start playing this game, as it has a different mode for every kind of player, like Team Deathmatch, Battle Royale and more. It will also give you the chance to chat with your friends while they play from their homes.Ludo StarIf you want to reminisce about your childhood, when your friends used to come over and all of you would play Ludo, you can download Ludo Star. This game allows you to play Ludo with your friends wherever they are and chat with them via voice or text. You can also play the game with your family members or roommates. You can also connect with random people and make new friends.Asphalt 9: LegendsAsphalt 9: Legends is a pure racing game, that will be able to give you most of the thrill that a real race car would be able to. Asphalt 9: Legends is the best the series has to offer as of now in terms of graphics and controls. Another feature is that they also have a licence from a lot of car companies to use their car names and designs. Thus, providing you with the extra bit of realism.Subscription service (PlayStation 4, Xbox One)My first option would be to get the PlayStation Plus or Xbox Gold service as it will provide you with a number of free games that you can play during this quarantine. It is more fun as you do not know which games will come up the following month, hence helping you grow as a gamer, by pushing you to play different genres of games.The Last of Us (PlayStation 4)Read the name of the game. Yes, that is what it is. Sure coronavirus is not turning people into hideous monsters, but it is no joke.¬† This game will help provide you with a vent as you try and stay alive in a post-apocalyptic Earth where you‚Äôre likely to be killed by other humans. This game might make people anxious about the future, so we recommend that you play this with caution.Resident Evil 7: Biohazard (PlayStation 4, Xbox One, PC)Resident Evil is a series that comes to any gamers mind, when you say the word zombie. And why would it not, it is one of the best zombie games there is, with the right amount of thrill, horror and storyline.Why I chose this version to recommend you is because in this you are trapped in a home, with the Baker family that is very bad at social distancing and is confirmed to be infected. It‚Äôs one of the best horror genre games that I have played to date. A bonus point would be if you would happen to have a PS VR, to play it on. The horror just intensifies.Tom Clancy‚Äôs The Division 2 (PlayStation 4, Xbox One, PC)This game can be is the most relatable in the current scenario. Your character is a part of an elite squad must re-establish peace in a lawless America, set in the aftermath of a viral (weaponised smallpox). To some, it might feel borderline offensive. So play at your own risk.FIFA 2020 (PlayStation 4, Xbox One, PC)To get out of the dark and gritty, you can play the new FIFA 2020, which has been developed by Volta and EA in collaboration. This collaboration provides us with two games at once, FIFA Street and FIFA. This helps the gamers change to a different version of FIFA when bored. It is quite an interesting and fun game that helps you have the fun of watching football even when there are no football matches taking place.NFS Heat (PlayStation 4, Xbox One, PC)If racing games is your genre then NFS Heat is the game that you need to play. It brings back the memories that you might have made while playing the original NFS Most Wanted. It is basically Most Wanted on steroids with better graphics and controls. However, not all is good and the fact that you need to shift between day and night and complete some missions in between just make the game a tad bit boring.Assassin‚Äôs Creed Odyssey (PlayStation 4, Xbox One, PC)Assassin‚Äôs Creed Odyssey is a very long game (40+ hours), so you won‚Äôt be running out of the storyline anytime soon. And it basically lets you do what any other Assassin‚Äôs Creed game allows you to do, and that is jumping, exploring and assassinating. It a fun game, and even though I have not completed it, it intrigued me enough to recommend it to everybody.The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the WildThis is a game that tells the story as to what happened when Link is trying to repair the damage that happened during a 100-year-old war that Link and Princess Zelda lost against Ganon. There is a lot of exploration that is needed to be done and it has an interesting story line that can provide you with a fun time during this lockdown.Pokemon Sword and Pokemon ShieldPokemon games that are available for Nintendo consoles are extremely engaging and fun. The last Pokemon game I played was Pokemon Black and from what I have seen in the trailers, it is a must have game. With it you get to travel the fictional Pokemon world, capturing various different Pokemons and then battling it out to be the best.Super Mario Maker 2Mario has been one of the most popular video game characters owned by Nintendo ever since its first game was launched. The character since then has been featured in multiple game series. Super Mario Maker 2 lets gamers create their own custom courses using assets from various games across the Super Mario franchise and then play them themselves or share them online for others to play. It reminds users of the older days, when they used to play Super Marios Bros on an 8-bit gaming console.üì£ The Indian Express is now on Telegram.

We have already discussed how fraudsters are posing as WHO officials to carry out phishing attacks, tricking people to click on malicious links or download harmful content, registering new malicious websites related to COVID-19, putting up fake coronavirus apps¬†and setting up fake COVID-19 tracking dashboards to hack computers.Now there is a new scam doing the rounds. A new report by Sophos ‚Äî a British security software and hardware company ‚Äî shows that cybercriminals are using extortion emails claiming they will infect a user‚Äôs family with coronavirus if the user does not pay the ransom money.Sextortion is well-known among people where cybercriminals send ‚Äúdirty little secret‚Äô emails saying they‚Äôve got hold of the user‚Äôs compromising pictures via malware and they‚Äôll leak it to the whole world, including their friends and family‚Äî unless the user decides to pay them a hefty amount of ransom money.In the new trend, criminals have tweaked the extortion to match up with the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. Cybercriminals are sending emails asking for $4000 via Bitcoins or else they‚Äôll not only reveal secrets, but will infect every member of the victim‚Äôs family with coronavirus.To sound authentic and get the person‚Äôs attention, the sender first reveals the password that was previously used by the victim. They claim they know all the passwords and that they have been keeping a close watch on the user, and could even infect their family with coronavirus. The email also includes a threat to reveal all of the user‚Äôs secrets. Check out the whole email in the screenshot attached below:There‚Äôs a chance they could have extracted your password from publicly available data leaked in an old data breach. So even if the whole this is a scam, what do to now? Paul Ducklin, the Principal Research Scientist at Sophos, explains that there is no need to be scared. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt send any money.

https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/after-scrapping-mobile-world-congress-organiser-gsma-offers-refunds-6331442/,"After scrapping Mobile World Congress, organiser GSMA offers refunds",2020-03-25 19:11:15+05:30,"The organiser of the world‚Äôs biggest mobile technology conference, MWC 2020 in Barcelona, will offer refunds or discounts to future gatherings to the tens of thousands of attendees and companies that had paid to attend February‚Äôs canceled event.
MWC was an early major casualty of the coronavirus pandemic, and it had never been scrapped in its 33-year history. By removing it from the calendar, telecom heavyweights lost a significant opportunity to generate marketing buzz around their latest wares. The industry‚Äôs biggest players often spend tens of millions of dollars to exhibit at the show, and smaller ones pay in the hundreds of thousands.On Wednesday the GSMA, the trade body for the mobile technology industry, said in a statement it will offer full refunds to all attendees for the cost of their tickets, which cost 799 euros ($865) for a basic admissions pass. For large exhibitors, the GSMA wants to incentivize discounts on attending the show in future years as an alternative to claiming large refunds.Mats Granryd, the director general of the GSMA, said in an interview with Bloomberg at the time MWC was canceled that the trade body was ‚Äúlooking for solidarity‚Äù and everybody bearing their own costs.It looks like that may be happening, to some extent. Some large operators have already expressed to the GSMA their intention to participate in MWC next year, according to a person with direct knowledge of the situation. These include Orange SA, Telefonica SA, Vodafone Group Plc and NTT Docomo.Larger companies will get the option of receiving a credit worth 125% of what they paid to exhibit at this year‚Äôs show, which will be applied as a 65% discount on the cost of attending next year, plus 35% and 25% discounts on the two subsequent years respectively.Alternatively, they can claim refunds equivalent to 50% of their spend for MWC 2020, up to a maximum of 150,000 pounds ($178,000).For smaller exhibitors ‚Äî those who spent up to 5,000 pounds ‚Äî a full refund will be offered. However, these firms can also opt to waive a refund and instead be granted a 125% credit and three years of discounts.Companies that had canceled their attendance prior to the GSMA calling of the show will be offered credits and discounts, but not cash refunds. The GSMA‚Äôs board is made up of executives from a number of the world‚Äôs biggest operators, including Vodafone and Deutsche Telekom AG, who agreed to the initial cancellation. The GSMA isn‚Äôt expecting its operator members to seek refunds.About 80% of the GSMA‚Äôs annual budget is derived from the money it generates from MWC Barcelona, according to two people familiar with the group‚Äôs budget.But internally, executives don‚Äôt consider the cancellation of MWC 2020 and Wednesday‚Äôs offer of refunds to be an existential threat, according to an executive with direct knowledge of board-level conversations who didn‚Äôt want to be named discussing private matters.üì£ The Indian Express is now on Telegram.

https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-reviews/mi-dual-driver-in-ear-earphones-review-balanced-audio-at-a-budget-6331406/,Mi Dual Driver In-ear Earphones review: Balanced audio at a budget?,2020-03-26 12:48:10+05:30,"The Indian consumer puts a lot of emphasis on bass when it comes to audio preferences that‚Äôs why a lot of manufacturers focus primarily on lows in their speakers and headphones. However, it has led to the neglect of mids and highs in earphones‚Äî at least in the budget segment leaving you no with no choice, but to shell out more money to go for a premium offering for balanced audio.That‚Äôs the problem Xiaomi claims to have solved with its Mi Dual Driver In-ear Earphones, but is this affordable product able to deliver what it claims? The product is priced competitively at Rs 799 and here‚Äôs what I think about the product after a month of usage.Right from the get-go, the Mi Dual Driver In-ear Earphones remind of the Realme Buds 2. It has a braided cable, the earpiece sets have magnetic ends, the mic is affixed on the right cord with volume rockers and play/pause buttons.Although Realme‚Äôs offering looked more premium than Xiaomi‚Äôs product, there are few things that I liked in the Mi Dual Driver In-ear Earphones. These are light-weight earbuds; I could use the earphones straight for three-hours without feeling the urge to take them out. The plastic cover over the magnetic end that saves the paint from scratches. Also, there is kevlar-style design underneath the plastic and it looks quite good.The anodized aluminium earbuds have a matte finish that is fingerprint-resistant and looks good too‚Äîespecially the blue-coloured variant. The earbuds tips are angular in shape and ensure a better fit. You also get additional tips in the box with different sizes so you can switch them with the right size.The overall design looks sturdy and the braided cable prevents the wires from tangling. I kept the earphones in my pockets and laptop bag and never had to struggle to untangle it. The Mi Dual Driver In-ear Earphones come with an L-shaped connector that is definitely more practical.The right cable in the Y-splitter carries the microphone and remote which falls within the reach. The buttons are tactile and the mic works just fine. Also since the mic hangs at the right height, you do not need to adjust it while receiving or making a call.Coming to the sound quality, Mi Dual Driver In-ear Earphones come with Dual Driver ‚Äî one 10mm and another 8mm Dynamic Driver. Xiaomi says that one driver handles the low frequencies while the other takes care of mids and highs. However, in practical usage, I did not feel much of a difference.The Mi Dual Driver In-ear Earphones are mostly bass-heavy and you can feel the strong lows while listening to bass-centric tracks. People who like strong bass will definitely like this.Express Tech is now on Telegram. Click here to join our channel (@expresstechnology) and stay updated with the latest tech newsI was really hoping that Xiaomi‚Äôs claims regarding the efficient handling of mids and highs come true, but looks like there is much work to do. The highs are acceptable, but mids are not that clear as the bass boost spills over here. You can feel the effect even when you listen to podcasts.Overall, the Mi Dual Driver In-ear Earphones do not offer a balanced audio experience but are perfect as a daily driver and for bass-heavy soundtracks. For those who want budget earphones under Rs 1,000 can definitely consider Mi Dual Driver In-ear Earphones for its light-weight design and bass-heavy performance.üì£ The Indian Express is now on Telegram.

https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/cold-flu-or-covid-19-this-ai-tool-can-help-you-differentiate-6331334/,"Cold, flu or Covid-19? This AI tool can help you differentiate",2020-03-26 21:16:52+05:30,"The coronavirus is confusing for the common man, since its similar to any common flu. And this creates confusion about who can, or should, get tested. To tackle this problem, Sydney-based Medius Health has created Quro, a risk assessment tool to determine whether you should be tested for Covid-19 or not. The AI digital health startup run by Indian Abhi Bhatia has so far done more than 75,000 consultations since rolling out the tool on March 4 in India and Australia.‚ÄúWhen Covid-19 hit, we had enough understanding of how we can utilise our medical knowledge graph at the backend and developed an AI-powered risk assessment tool which presents the users with questions related to symptoms and risk factors in accordance with the World Health Organisation protocols and guidelines,‚Äù the founder of Medius Health told indianexpress.com over phone from Sydney.Quro, an AI-based risk assessment tool, is like an anonymous consultation where people do not need to sign up or give personal details. The tool, which acts as a virtual health guide, asks a number of questions such as your travel history, past medical history, your symptoms, what sort of problems you are having right now from a symptomatic point of view and so on. The tool is free to use and can be accessed on the web.But collecting the data is one part of the story, says Bhatia. His team, which consists of data scientists and clinical scientists, has created an artificial intelligence (AI) system called disease frequency and evoking strength that extracts the data and using different combinations, it understands the relation between symptoms and disease. And based on that, its AI system predicts whether a person is at higher risk for getting sick from Covid-19 or not.The system gets updated frequently, based on the data and the trend provided by the World Health Organisation (WHO) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). ‚ÄúWe keep on updating the prevalence rate value of those relationships between coronavirus and a particular symptom. So for instance, when coronavirus started picking up, the doctors realised that nasal congestion is the one thing that actually differentiates between a flu as well as coronavirus, but then a lot of things have changed,‚Äù he said.Bhatia said the aim was to ‚Äúquell the panic‚Äù and at the same time offer ‚Äúthe right set of information‚Äù so that people should know that this could be a mere cold and flu and not Covid-19. He further added that the tool will help identify those people who have a high risk of Coronavirus and need to get the testing done.The tool [Quro] will help people understand how to differentiate between symptoms that are more relevant to coronavirus versus influenza. That is the biggest problem right now because everyone who‚Äôs coughing and has some sort of nasal congestion, they feel that it‚Äôs a coronavirus and it‚Äôs creating a lot of panic among people,‚Äù he explains.Citing the example of India, Bhatia said the risk assessment tool could be useful for a country with a population of 1 billion, where unnecessary fear among people about Covid-19 can put a lot of burden on hospitals and healthcare institutions.According to Bhatia, 69.2 per cent of people from India who have accessed the risk indicator have lower chances of contracting Covid-19, 22.7 per cent of profiles fall in the moderate risk category and just 9.1 per cent of people are at a higher risk of complications from the deadly virus.Bhatia feels that the tool can help government agencies and health organisations in understanding the magnitude of Covid 19 and take necessary steps before it gets too late to stop it from spreading.The company has reached out to the Ministry of Health to push out the risk assessment tool to a large population base in India. Meanwhile, Medius Health is working with a couple of partners in India to deploy the tool, including ICICI Prudential and Bajaj Financial Services. The company is also developing a special platform for Max Healthcare.It took Bhatia and his team 8-9 days to develop the tool. ‚ÄúBefore we roll out any AI tool, we train the model and then we have to do internal testing. In this case, we created different kinds of case simulations that we picked up from Wuhan. For instance, who was traveling, where these people were traveling, what was the age group, what was the gender, what geographical patterns that they have, what was the onset of symptoms? So we picked up that data from WHO and created AI-driven case simulations that we then injected into our platform,‚Äù he said.At a time when the developed countries like the US and Italy are failing to stop the coronavirus outbreak, Bhatia acknowledged that the use of Artificial intelligence (AI) can be a game-changer in healthcare.‚ÄúAI comes into play as early detection, collecting the data on a mass scale so that we can create epidemiological population-level information through which the government can allocate the resources at the right place, and put people in the right bucket. So if there‚Äôs a high-risk person, he should be the one who should be isolated first and get proper testing done,‚Äù Bhatia said.He further that those data points will further help train models and the AI engine would even be able to predict within those high-risk people who are least touched to coronavirus and who are more prone to infectious disease.Medius Health, which was founded in 2017, has a team of 32 people including data scientists, doctors and software engineers. The startup has so far raised AUD 4.2 million in two rounds and is looking to close its Series A from a consortium of investors from India and Singapore.üì£ The Indian Express is now on Telegram.

https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/coronavirus-internet-speeds-slow-netflix-hotstar-amazon-prime-youtube-reduce-streaming-quality-6331237/,"Coronavirus impact: As internet speeds fall, streaming services forced to dial down quality",2020-03-26 11:02:43+05:30,"The coronavirus pandemic is breaking the internet, in every sense of the word. Trends observed by Ookla, known for its SpeedTest app and website, show that across the world fixed broadband and mobile broadband networks are seeing a decline in their speeds, ranging from 10 per cent to 20 per cent in some cases. The reason: more and more people are now in lockdown, working from home, and with children staying back as well, there is increased burden on networks.One major factor for this is video, according to Doug Suttles, Co-founder and General Manager at Ookla. ‚ÄúOver half of the internet uses video. Anything else is small in comparison. The issue is that everyone‚Äôs working from home and suddenly kids don‚Äôt have school and they are home too. There‚Äôs a whole lot more video consumption. It‚Äôs gotten a lot larger,‚Äù Suttles explains, adding that ISPs cannot add capacity overnight to their networks.To give some context, JustWatch, an international streaming guide, has seen a 60 per cent spike in traffic from India and 81 per cent from US. So world over streaming services are now working to reduce the load. In India too, most major streaming players have followed suit and announced measures.YouTube, for which India is the biggest market in terms of consumers, confirmed Tuesday it was reducing its default video quality to standard definition across the world. In India, YouTube streaming will be at 480p on mobile networks by default until April 14, which is when the official lockdown declared by the government is supposed to end.‚ÄúWe continue to work closely with governments and network operators around the globe to do our part to minimise stress on the system during this unprecedented situation. Last week, we announced that we were temporarily defaulting all videos on YouTube to standard definition in the EU. Given the global nature of this crisis, we will expand that change globally starting today,‚Äù a Google spokesperson says on this change.Read our guide on how to ensure that streaming websites don‚Äôt consume all your data¬†Other players in India like Sony, Facebook, Amazon Prime Video, Viacom18, Zee, Hotstar, TikTok and MX Player have also agreed to stream at SD or standard definition content, in order to ensure there is no strain on the networks, which will consume less data.In a collective decision, the companies have announced they will temporarily be defaulting HD and ultra-HD streaming to SD content or offering only SD content at bitrates no higher than 480p on cellular networks. The measures will stay in effect till April 14.Meanwhile, Netflix has decided to reduce load on the telecommunications networks in India by 25 per cent, while maintaining the quality of service for the next 30 days. ‚ÄúGiven the crisis, we‚Äôve developed a way to reduce Netflix‚Äôs traffic on telecommunications networks by 25% while also maintaining the quality of our service. So consumers should continue to get the quality that comes with their plan ‚Äì whether it‚Äôs Ultra-High, High or Standard Definition,‚Äù says Ken Florance, VP Content Delivery, Netflix in a statement.Work from Home appears to be the norm for many of us. We at Indian Express tech have some articles which could help make this easier. First, how to optimise your WiFi, which is really important. Read on that here. Next, we explain how to save data on WhatsApp given we might be using a lot more of this. Then we explain how you can balance screen time while doing work from home. Also these video calling apps can be useful when relying on work from home. Don‚Äôt let it be all about work, you can rely on these fitness apps to continue that workout during the lockdown. And finally some general tips to keep in mind while working from home. So if a customer wants to continue streaming at a higher resolution, and their plan allows the option, the content will be available at that UHD or HD or SD resolution, except the streaming will be at a lower bitrate. The company has removed the highest bandwidth streams in order to reduce load on the networks.While on-demand video streaming platforms are working to reduce the load on networks, there‚Äôs no doubt that the increased demand has impacted speeds in India already. The good news is that Ookla‚Äôs numbers showed that while fixed or wired broadband has declined at some level in India, it is not so sharp.But mobile broadband has seen a steeper decline of about 10 per cent across networks. The data shows that in India there is also a 5 per cent decline in upload speeds for mobile and fixed broadband as well.‚ÄúThe trends are similar in India to what we are seeing over the world. Week-over-week, there‚Äôs a clear uptick in testing. People are concerned with their network, having issues and wanting to solve those problems. In India, we are seeing about a 10 per cent decline in performance for mobile broadband networks, though the fixed broadband networks have not seen such a sharp decline,‚Äù Suttles says.The decline in mobile networks is not surprising if one looks at the numbers put out by the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) on the number of subscribers for mobile vs fixed broadband. Wired broadband connections stood at 19.13 million subscribers as seen on December 31, 2019. In contrast, the number of mobile broadband subscribers stands at 642 million. For many mobile is the primary and only form of internet connectivity and in these congested times, the networks will face an increased burden.More around coronavirus impact on the tech worldSamsung, Oppo, vivo shut down factories in India | Coronavirus outbreak is impacting Indian smartphone market | From Kerala, a robot to take care of coronavirus patientsIn countries where work from home has been mandated, and is being followed, there is a 10 to 20 per cent reduction in performance. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs different in some countries is that it has affected mobile broadband more. India is an example of that. In the United States, it has impacted fixed broadband but mobile speeds have stayed the same,‚Äù explains Suttles.Another trend that Ookla has observed is that there is a general uptick in the number of people running speed tests to check on internet quality. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs interesting because usually it happens more often in the evening for fixed broadband when people come home from work. People are testing throughout the day and night now. More mobile tests used to happen typically during the day, but now we are seeing all kinds of tests throughout the day,‚Äù he adds.It is not just video streaming services that are working to optimise their services. Content Delivery Networks (CDN‚Äôs) such as Akamai are also working to reduce traffic congestion.Akamai announced it will work with leading distributors of software, particularly for the gaming industry, including Microsoft and Sony, to help manage congestion during peak usage periods. Gaming software downloads account for large amounts of internet traffic and it will be crucial to manage this, especially as more people are staying home.Express Tech is now on Telegram. Click here to join our channel (@expresstechie) and stay updated with the latest tech news‚ÄúAkamai‚Äôs intelligent edge network architecture is inherently designed to mitigate and minimise network congestion, and because we have deployed our infrastructure deep into carrier networks, we can help those networks avoid overload by diverting traffic away from areas experiencing high levels of congestion,‚Äù a statement quotes Dr Tom Leighton, the CEO and Co-Founder of Akamai.In regions where demand is creating bottlenecks for customers, Akamai will be reducing gaming software downloads at peak times, and completing the downloads at the normal fast speeds late at night. The approach, it says, will ensure that while gamers can still get their downloads, health workers will not face any issues with the digital services that are vital.Another consequence of the lockdowns is more usage of VPN or Virtual Private Networks, which can help users access websites or content which might not be allowed in their country. According to ExpressVPN, it has seen an increase of 21 per cent in the average global usage of its service since the end of February. In India, there‚Äôs been a growth of 15 per cent in VPN usage.‚ÄúWe are seeing strong demand in our services as more people spend more time indoors and employees around the world telework,‚Äù says a statement from Harold Li, vice president, ExpressVPN.But how long will the strain on the networks continue? The Ookla co-founder gives the example of China and how the situation played out there, where the coronavirus outbreak began and was followed by a lockdown in Wuhan.‚ÄúSix weeks ago, China looked like the other parts of the world do now, where everyone shifted to working from home. There were a lot of slowdowns on the internet. It took five to six weeks for things to return to normal there. But as of the last two weeks, it looks like it used to before,‚Äù he points out.In his view, if the lockdowns and social distancing measures are adhered to, and everyone does stay home, it would take a month or so for internet speeds to get back to normal, though he cautions, it will depend on the number of people actually staying at home.üì£ The Indian Express is now on Telegram.

https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/gaming/apples-app-store-rules-limit-rival-gaming-services-while-arcade-runs-free-6331291/,Apple‚Äôs App Store rules limit rival gaming services while Arcade runs free,2020-03-25 17:40:04+05:30,"Video-game fans suddenly have their pick of a huge menu of titles thanks to a raft of new mobile subscription services from Apple Inc, Microsoft Corp, Alphabet Inc‚Äôs Google and Nvidia Corp. But for the more than 1 billion users of Apple‚Äôs iPhone and iPad, the only real option is Arcade, the subscription service launched by the company in September.That‚Äôs because Apple imposes strict limits on the kinds of apps users can access on its devices. For example, App Store guidelines ban services that rely on streaming from the cloud. Arcade adheres to the requirements, in part, because it‚Äôs included as a feature within the App Store itself. This is the latest example of what critics say are arbitrary rules favoring Apple‚Äôs own apps at the expense of similar software from outside developers.‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a fraught relationship between developers and Apple precisely because of rules like this,‚Äù said David Barnard, a longtime independent developer and advocate at RevenueCat. ‚ÄúIn some ways, I am incredibly grateful to their marketplace for helping me make millions of dollars I wouldn‚Äôt have made without it. On the flip side, them being so heavy handed at times does kill apps and does cause developers to miss out on other potential revenue.‚ÄùIf software developers want to reach as many consumers as possible, they have to be on Apple‚Äôs iOS. The operating system powers more than 1 billion smartphones and tablets and it‚Äôs the only way to access the iOS App Store, which accounted for 65 per cent of app spending globally last year, according to Sensor Tower. The Cupertino, California-based company can also make or break mobile gaming businesses: More than half of the $62 billion spent on smartphone gaming last year happened on Apple products.Cloud gaming services, where users stream games live over the internet, are growing in popularity, especially as faster fifth-generation, or 5G, wireless networks proliferate. The new offerings from Microsoft, Nvidia and Google are cloud streaming-based, while Apple Arcade is not. Those other services are found on the Android operating system, which powers 2.5 billion devices worldwide. Among the popular games found there, and missing from iOS, are Red Dead Redemption 2, Gears of War 5 and Destiny 2.Asked about the challenge of reaching iPhone and iPad users with the chipmaker‚Äôs GeForce Now service, an Nvidia spokesperson said: ‚ÄúAsk Apple.‚ÄùApple said its ‚Äúcustomers enjoy great apps and games from millions of developers and gaming services can absolutely launch on the App Store‚Äù if they follow the App Review Guidelines, which means that games have to be submitted individually, allowing them to appear in App Store rankings and search. The company also said it intends to continue building on its relationships with developers and providing a level playing field.‚ÄúDevelopers can choose to reach all iPhone and iPad users over the web through Safari and other browsers on the App Store,‚Äù Apple said. But currently the new cloud-based gaming streaming services aren‚Äôt accessible through web browsers on iPhones and iPads.Whether the restrictions raise antitrust issues is another matter. The policies were in place before the latest gaming services launched, and ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt see it cutting one way or the other,‚Äù said David Reichenberg, an antitrust lawyer at Cozen O‚ÄôConnor.Apple said there is strong competition in every category in which it makes its own apps. Arcade, only available on iOS, is $4.99 per month for more than 100 games and is a growing contributor to the company‚Äôs services revenue, which is important amid a period of reduced hardware sales growth.At least one gaming subscription offering, GameClub, has managed to get on the App Store. It licensed several old-school games, released them all on the App Store as separate apps under one developer account and offers one $4.99 subscription that works across the apps. Still, it was rejected 127 times by Apple before being approved. ‚ÄúThe amount of effort we put into making sure the app played by Apple‚Äôs rules was no joke, it was a huge undertaking,‚Äù Eli Hodapp, GameClub‚Äôs head of business development, said.In February, Microsoft released a beta version of its gaming service, currently dubbed xCloud. It is still in free preview, but is expected to launch later this year as a paid service under the company‚Äôs Game Pass brand. A look at the software shows the contortions that it and other Arcade rivals will have to pull off to get on Apple‚Äôs system. While Microsoft‚Äôs has a catalog of 90 games available on Android, just one, Halo, appears on the iPhone test version. Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft and Mountain View, California-based Google declined to comment.The Android variant of xCloud lets users choose from multiple games built by different publishers. A version of the app on iOS could only have games either developed or exclusively licensed by Microsoft.Apple outlines this in an App Store rule that says ‚Äúgames offered in a game subscription must be owned or exclusively licensed by the developer.‚Äù For example, Microsoft‚Äôs iOS service can offer Halo because Microsoft produces that game, but not Ace Combat from Bandai Namco.This restriction prevents game developers from being able to work with game partners already on other platforms. Apple said Arcade complies with all the guidelines. Microsoft makes several of its own games, but Google and Nvidia would only be able to launch if they exclusively licensed third-party titles. Google‚Äôs Stadia costs $9.99 per month and new games are added monthly. Nvidia offers free and $4.99 per month subscription tiers, but requires a user to login to a Valve Steam account to access many titles.A related guideline bans the subscription services from carrying over upgrades like levels, extra weapons and characters unless they are also available as an in-app purchase in the App Store. Like many other apps, this gives Apple a 30 per cent cut of revenue from developers, while confusing users who play video games on multiple platforms. It also means more overhead for developers.If a developer is able to build or license enough games for a service, they would still be prohibited from releasing an all-you-can-eat gaming subscription service on iOS that works inside of a single app.Many games are available to be downloaded individually from their creators, but consumers increasingly like to subscribe to a bundle of games at a lower monthly price ‚Äî much like they‚Äôd subscribe to Apple Music instead of downloading individual songs or sign up for Netflix instead of buying specific movies.The same rule that bars non-exclusive titles requires that ‚Äúeach game must be downloaded directly from the App Store.‚Äù This means an app can‚Äôt include a catalog of games and must be broken up into separate apps. Apple said the guideline is to prevent games from being added or removed without review. Apple allows catalog apps for magazines, newspapers, music, videos and books.‚ÄúThe App Store was created to be a safe and trusted place for customers to discover and download apps, and a great business opportunity for all developers,‚Äù Apple said. ‚ÄúBefore they go on our store, all apps are reviewed against the same set of guidelines that are intended to protect customers and provide a fair and level playing field to developers.‚ÄùWhile a game developer could feasibly workaround the first few games-related guidelines, Apple‚Äôs decision to block games that stream directly from the cloud is an iOS deal-killer for Microsoft‚Äôs xCloud, Google‚Äôs Stadia and Nvidia‚Äôs GeForce NOW.Apple‚Äôs rules state that ‚Äúthin clients for cloud-based apps are not appropriate for the App Store.‚Äù This type of app does little on the device, with most of the action offloaded to remote data centers, much like how Netflix streams movies. In contrast, each Apple Arcade game runs fully on the device without the need to stream data from the cloud.Cloud streaming works on an early test version of Microsoft‚Äôs app, but if a full app like that was submitted to the Apple App Store it would probably be rejected. Microsoft‚Äôs beta app is available currently to 10,000 users through an Apple testing service called TestFlight, which traditionally follows the same rules as the App Store.Apple says that developers that publish games on the App Store benefit from features like Siri, backups and App Store promotion. Having to build a service without cloud streaming would be a lot more work for traditional game developers and would mean they have to re-create their apps for each platform rather than leverage their existing game libraries.Apple lets devlopers use a technology called remote desktop. This is similar to cloud streaming, but instead of piping in content from a data center, the game is streamed from a Mac, Windows computer, or gaming console. This method comes with a major caveat: users can only stream from a computer or console that they own and the iPhone must be on the same network as the first device. That means you can stream a game in your living room, but not on the bus to work.That has allowed apps like Sony‚Äôs PS4 Remote Play and Valve Steam Link. Microsoft xCloud for Android has a similar option for streaming from an Xbox, but the feature is missing from the iPhone. It‚Äôs unclear why Microsoft didn‚Äôt include it.Major technology companies aren‚Äôt the only ones having trouble getting on the App Store. For months, one app from Shadow, a Paris-based cloud gaming developer, appeared to survive Apple‚Äôs rules. That changed at the end of February when Shadow‚Äôs platform was removed. Shadow relied on streaming games from PCs in a server farm, versus computers owned by users. Shadow said it‚Äôs talking to Apple about getting back on the App Store.

https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/social/facebook-is-just-trying-to-keep-the-lights-on-as-traffic-soars-in-pandemic-6331205/,Facebook is ‚Äòjust trying to keep the lights on‚Äô as traffic soars in pandemic,2020-03-25 20:32:57+05:30,"As the coronavirus spread around the world and people everywhere were ordered to stay home, phone calls over Facebook‚Äôs apps more than doubled. In many countries, messaging on Instagram and Facebook soared by more than 50%, while group calls in Italy jumped by more than 1,000%. And hungry for information, people clicked repeatedly on virus news stories shown by the social network.Inside Facebook, that meant the pressure was on.‚ÄúWe‚Äôre just trying to keep the lights on over here,‚Äù Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook‚Äôs chief executive, said in an interview last week.As airlines, hotels, restaurants and other companies struggle to stay afloat during the pandemic, Facebook is also laboring to cope with the fallout. But unlike those other businesses, the Silicon Valley giant is being strained by the coronavirus in a different way: Its usage is going through the roof.Skyrocketing traffic and a crush of new users are now stressing Facebook‚Äôs systems just as its 45,000 employees are dealing with working remotely for the first time. The company is also trying to keep its users‚Äô data secure while employees who sift through posts to moderate content do so from home. At the same time, Facebook has added to its workload by promising to do more to limit virus misinformation.It is a pressure test moment for Facebook, which has for years grappled with a backlash over privacy and toxic content, but now has a chance to change that narrative and be seen as an essential communications and information tool during the outbreak.‚ÄúThe usage growth from COVID-19 is unprecedented across the industry, and we are experiencing new records in usage almost every day,‚Äù Alex Schultz and Jay Parikh, two Facebook vice presidents working on infrastructure, said in a blog post on Tuesday. ‚ÄúMaintaining stability throughout these spikes in usage is more challenging than usual now that most of our employees are working from home.‚ÄùWhat has saved Facebook‚Äôs network from crashing altogether, Zuckerberg said, was that the virus and the quarantines have had the largest impact in just a few areas where Facebook operates. Facebook is banned in China, where the virus first appeared, for instance.Those areas that have the highest concentration of people using Facebook‚Äôs services during peak hours from home are also spread out by time zone, Zuckerberg said, which staggers the swell of traffic.‚ÄúIt really is a big technical challenge,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre basically trying to ready everything we can.‚Äù He said Facebook had mobilized its engineers to make sure the company has enough computing capacity and adequate support to handle the surges.The strain has been compounded by Facebook‚Äôs workforce adapting to working from home, which had been discouraged in the past.The company‚Äôs executives have long preached internally that face-to-face meetings and in-person collaboration were central to Facebook‚Äôs success. The importance of in-person conversation was so great that employees at offices from Singapore to New York were frequently asked to travel to the company‚Äôs headquarters in Menlo Park, California, for quarterly meetings.That has made the transition to working from home especially difficult, said four Facebook employees who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly.To communicate, Facebook employees were told to use BlueJeans, which provides technology for videoconferencing calls, they said. But they quickly found that calls were frozen, or the video quality so bad that it was hard to make out who was speaking. Many employees instead turned to Apple‚Äôs FaceTime feature, Google video hangouts or Zoom conference calls. Some even built their own version of a video conference call, according to two employees.Issues quickly piled up.Two days into working from home, some Facebook managers sent the engineering teams a message: limit idle chat on work message boards.Facebook employees had been posting on those boards at a record rate, according to one employee. While some workers were sharing tips and best practices of how to set up a home office, others were sharing links to buy heirloom seeds for at-home farming, and instructions on how to sew their own face masks, one employee said.Other snafus surfaced.Last week, a bug within Facebook‚Äôs system began marking thousands of posts by major news outlets like Politico and The Sydney Morning Herald as spam, which resulted in the removal of the posts. It took Facebook a day to correct the mistake, as engineers struggled to communicate remotely with one another over how the bug had been introduced and what it would take to fix it.While they scrambled, rumors spread among Facebook‚Äôs users over the source of the bug, with many accusing the company of censoring people‚Äôs speech. Internally, Facebook managers said that while the bug was routine, the amount of time it took to fix it was not.‚ÄúThis was just a technical error, and we‚Äôre still doing the post-mortem to understand what happened so we can operationalize any learnings from that,‚Äù Zuckerberg said last week.Working from home has also made moderating Facebook‚Äôs posts more difficult. This month, Facebook put its army of global contractors from outside agencies on paid leave. Those contractors, who number more than 15,000, are responsible for sorting through the posts, images and videos that flow through Facebook‚Äôs services on a daily basis to weed out sensitive, explicit or hateful material.As the outbreak spread, contractors were ordered not to come into the office, where they worked on protected networks behind virtual firewalls to maintain user privacy. Many of those contractors do not have the same technology setup at home.Facebook is still trying to figure out how to let the contractors continue working. For now, it is relying on full-time employees, who do not have the training or the time, to moderate the posts themselves.Given that, Facebook employees have been asked to remove only the most sensitive, fringe posts, said one employee. The company also told employees that it would rely more heavily on their artificial intelligence systems to flag and remove posts.‚ÄúI do think it‚Äôs reasonable to expect that for some of the other categories where the severity might not be as imminent or extreme, that we may be a little less effective in the near term while we‚Äôre adjusting to this,‚Äù Zuckerberg said.While Facebook‚Äôs usage is soaring, that may not translate into financial gains. Most of the increase in traffic has occurred on the company‚Äôs messaging services ‚Äî like WhatsApp and Messenger ‚Äî which bring in relatively little revenue. And though more people are using the main News Feed and Facebook Stories in the core app, the company said it wasn‚Äôt immune to a wider pullback in advertising.‚ÄúOur business is being adversely affected like so many others around the world,‚Äù Schultz and Parikh said in the blog post. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve seen a weakening in our ads business in countries taking aggressive actions to reduce the spread of COVID-19.‚ÄùZuckerberg said Facebook was doing what it could to prepare for the weeks ahead, as it doesn‚Äôt anticipate the issues to abate anytime soon.‚ÄúI‚Äôve never seen anything like this before,‚Äù he said.üì£ The Indian Express is now on Telegram.

According to a new study, these naturally occurring superconducting materials were found embedded inside two distinct meteorites that crash-landed on Earth.Superconductors are important for humans as the material can conduct electrical current without resistance. The material ensures ‚Äòperfect‚Äô conductivity and finds use in a lot of areas. Even though the superconductor inside the Australian meteorite is a known material, its discovery in space debris comes as a shock.Meteorites have been known to deliver minerals to Earth that we have never seen before as well as materials that are older than our Solar System itself. However, this is the first time meteorites crash-landed on Earth with embedded superconductive grains.Also Read | Earth‚Äôs mini-moon left the planet‚Äôs orbit, but there will be more to comeResearchers from UC San Diego investigated fragments from 15 different meteorites using magnetic field modulated microwave spectroscopy to detect traces of superconductivity inside samples. They found one in an iron meteorite Mundrabilla‚Äî one of the largest meteorites ever found that was discovered in Australia in 1911. The other one is a rare¬†ureilite¬†meteorite¬†GRA 95205 which was located in Antarctica a quarter-century ago.The study is published in the PNAS or Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America. According to the research, measurements and analysis identified alloys of lead, indium, and tin in the meteorite sample which were not previously found in space debris.‚ÄúEven the simplest superconducting mineral, lead, is only rarely found naturally in its native form, and, to our knowledge, there are no previous reports of natural lead samples superconducting,‚Äù the authors¬†explain in their paper.Express Tech is now on¬†Telegram.

Even though the alloys found in the samples do not act as superconductors at room temperature on Earth but there are locations of space colder than the 5-degrees-Kelvin at which these become a superconductor.Researchers say that these superconductive alloys could affect the magnetic fields surrounding them in the cold space, producing phenomena potentially visible to telescopes on Earth.

https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/opinion-technology/realme-blog-narzo-10-10a-launch-amid-coronavirus-pandemic-india-lockdown-6330648/,"The Realme Blog: The Narzo series is coming, but is this a good time? [Updated]",2020-03-25 11:08:20+05:30,"Recently Realme posted a video on its social media channels and everyone thought the company is releasing a music video or something. But no, it was the promo video of a new smartphone series called Narzo. Wait, what? Narzo? What does that even mean? Well, Realme is yet to reveal the mystery behind the name, but it does say that this series is for Generation Z aka the youth.It‚Äôs great that the company is trying different strategies to attract consumers but I feel it is a bad time to launch a smartphone in India given companies are being affected by the closure of manufacturing units and workers unable to come to work.The Narzo smartphone series was said to launch in India on March 26 but it has now been delayed due to 21-day pan India lockdown. Realme is yet to confirm the new launch date.It was supposed to be a recorded launch video as most employees are working from home. However, all this was before Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced a 21-day pan-India lockdown. Most companies have postponed their scheduled launch events to April.Here‚Äôs everything we know about Realme Narzo smartphone seriesRealme has also suspended its manufacturing operations in Greater Noida, Uttar Pradesh from March 21, 2020 due to coronavirus pandemic. The brand also said that COVID-19 will temporarily affect the inventory and supply in the market for some time. This could not just impact the sales of the Narzo series but also all other recently launched Realme phones.With Realme Narzo the company wants to be more than just a camera phone, given that has been its key focus for (almost) all its recently launched phones. It has revealed that both the Narzo 10 and Narzo 10 A will come with a powerful processor, impressive screen, big 5000mAh battery paired with fast charging support. Teasers have confirmed that the Narzo 10 will include four cameras at the back while there 10A will sport three of them.I feel the Realme Narzo series will take a different approach as far as the design is concerned. The teasers show that the Narzo 10 with quad cameras will sport Realme X special garlic and ginger edition like design with vertical lines throughout the rear panel of the phone. I had used the Realme X ginger edition for some time when it was launched last year and feel it‚Äôs still the best-designed Realme phone so far.What is Narzo? What does it mean?The Narzo 10A on the other hand sports a similar design as the Realme power bank with a huge vertically placed logo throughout the back cover. It looks different and unique from other phones from the company.It is still unclear why Realme is bringing a separate smartphone series in India given the market is already flooded with Realme number series, C series U series, Pro series, X series, and X Pro series phones.Note: After this blog was posted Realme informed us that the Narzo series launch has been delayed due to India lockdown. The new launch date hasn‚Äôt been revealed as yet.¬†Work from Home appears to be the norm for many of us. We at Indian Express tech have some articles which could help make this easier.

https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/techook/xiaomi-redmi-k30-pro-vs-poco-x2-6329450/,Redmi K30 Pro vs Poco X2: Which one is better?,2020-03-25 10:19:57+05:30,"Redmi K30 Pro is now official in China, and is the successor to last year‚Äôs Redmi K20 Pro. The K series under the Redmi brand offers flagship-like specifications, but at a more reasonable price, and this is a trend that has continued with the K30 phones as well. So it is not surprising the Redmi K30 Pro runs the Qualcomm Snapdragon 865 processor, which is the high-end variant for this year.While the Redmi K20 series was launched in India, the K30 series has not yet made an appearance, unless you count the Poco X2. That‚Äôs because the Poco X2 is essentially the re-branded version of the Redmi K30 in the Indian market, and it is quite an affordable phone for what it offers.There‚Äôs no word on whether Redmi K30 Pro will come to India and whether it will have a different name. But the new Redmi phone does raise some interest given what it offers. There‚Äôs also the question of how does the new Redmi K30 Pro phone compare to the previous phone.¬† Given the Poco X2 has the same specifications as the Redmi K30, we are comparing it to the new Redmi K30 Pro. Here‚Äôs a look at the specifications, features of the two phones.Redmi K30 Pro has been launched at Yuan 2,999 (approximately Rs 32,260) for the 6GB RAM/64GB storage variant, at Yuan 3,399 (approximately Rs 36,560) for the 8GB RAM/128GB storage variant and at Yuan 3,699 (approximately Rs 39,770) for the 8GB RAM/256GB storage variant.Express Tech is now on Telegram. Click here to join our channel (@expresstechie) and stay updated with the latest tech newsThe Poco X2 is comparatively much cheaper at Rs 15,999 for the 6GB RAM/64GB storage, Rs 16,999 for the 6GB RAM/128GB storage variant and Rs 19,999 for the 8GB RAM/256GB storage variant.The Redmi K30 Pro is being offered in Moonlight White, Sky Blue, Purple and Space Grey colour options. And the Poco X2 comes in Atlantis Blue, Matrix Purple and Phoenix Red colour options.Both the Poco X2 and the Redmi K30 Pro sport a glass back panel held together by a metal frame. Poco X2 comes with a p2i Splash-Proof coating, which makes it water repellant, however, the Redmi K30 Pro comes with a proper IP53 dust and water resistance rating.Also Read:¬†Poco X2, Redmi K20, Realme X2: These are best phones under Rs 20,000 right nowRedmi K30 Pro comes with an in-display fingerprint scanner, while the Poco X2 features a side-mounted one just like the Samsung Galaxy S10e.¬† Both the devices sport a circular looking camera module trying to mimic the Huawei Mate 30 Pro‚Äôs back camera. But based on the visuals, the Redmi K30 Pro‚Äôs camera looks better.One major differentiator between the two phones is that the Poco X2 has a pill-shaped cut-out to accommodate the front cameras, while the Redmi K30 Pro sports a motorised pop-up selfie camera. One advantage is that pop-up selfie camera does not hinder any content that you are viewing and ensures the true edge-to-edge display experience.Poco X2 does not have a proper pill-shaped cut-out, rather it has two separate holes joined by pixels that have been turned off using the software. This causes the Poco X2 to have a shadow effect near the cut-out.Also Read:¬†Realme 6 Pro vs Poco X2: Which mid-range should you buy?Redmi K30 Pro sports a 6.67-inch Super AMOLED display with HDR10+ support and has a 92.7 screen-to-body ratio. It comes with a 60Hz refresh rate panel according to various reports, however, Xiaomi is yet to comment on that. The device has a 180Hz touch sampling rate, which would make the display capable of at least 90Hz. However, Xiaomi could be holding this back due to software issues and might enable it at a later point with the help of an update.Poco X2 also comes with a 6.67-inch display. However, it uses IPS LCD technology instead of AMOLED technology. Where the Poco X2 pulls ahead is that it comes with a 120Hz refresh rate display. This would make the viewing experience better on the Poco X2, due to the smoothness of the display. It also enhances the gaming performance as there is minimal screen tearing while playing high frame rate games.Also Read:¬†What is Realme Narzo? Is it Realme‚Äôs answer to Redmi, Poco?Redmi K30 Pro comes with Qualcomm‚Äôs flagship Snapdragon 865 processor and comes with what Xiaomi calls as the ‚Äòlargest vapour chamber liquid cooling system.‚Äô¬† ¬†The Poco X2, on the other hand,¬† uses the Qualcomm Snapdragon 730G processor. The processor is good and can handle heavy gaming quite well, making it a good phone. But given the Redmi K30 Pro‚Äôs flagship processor, it will obviously show better results.The Redmi K30 Pro comes with a quad camera setup on the back, which consists of a 64MP Sony IMX686 primary sensor paired with a 13MP ultra-wide-angle lens, an 8MP telephoto lens and a 5MP depth sensor. The camera supports taking images in HEIF and RAW formats, They also support 8K video recording. On the front, it sports a 20MP motorised pop-up selfie camera, just like its predecessor the Redmi K20 Pro.Poco X2 also comes with a 64MP quad-camera setup on the back. This consists of a 64MP primary sensor, an 8MP ultra-wide-angle sensor, a 2MP depth sensor and a 2MP macro sensor. On the front, it has a dual camera setup consisting of a 20MP primary sensor paired with a 2MP depth sensor.Also Read:¬†Confused between Realme 6 and Redmi Note 9 Pro?

The coronavirus outbreak and subsequent lockdown means more people are working from home. Add to that schools are also closed and with children at home the end result is that a lot more data is being consumed whether for work or for entertainment purposes.Especially for those with children at home, streaming apps or services like YouTube, Hotstar, Netflix, Amazon Prime Video can all act like solid data guzzlers. Already Netflix, Amazon Prime Video have announced they will be reducing streaming quality in Europe, America.But there are settings in each of these apps to ensure that you can optimise your data consumption. We explain how to keep a track for some of the popular streaming services.The good thing about Netflix is that they give out comprehensive details on how much data is consumed based on the settings.¬†According to the help page, watching shows or movies on the streaming service will see the consumption of around 1GB of data per hour at standard definition or 720p. For HD video, this jumps up to 3GB of data per hour. The page also notes that ‚Äúdownloading and streaming consume a similar amount of data.‚ÄùSo how can you reduce some data usage on Netflix? Well, the service has four options for data usage. There‚Äôs low which consumes 0.3 GB per hour per device, followed by medium or SD, which comes to 0.7 GB per hour per device and high which consumes around 3GB per hour. The highest is the Ultra HD or 4K which consumes 7 GB per hour per device.Must read: From Kerala, a robot to take care of coronavirus patientsKeep in mind that the data usage settings only apply to the one Netflix profile.

Follow these steps to optimise your data consumption on the Netflix website.Log into Netflix.comSelect the profile for which would like to change your data usage settings for and select AccountUnder My Profile, select Playback SettingsSelect your desired data usage setting, though the default is usually at auto.

Higher will use more storage when you download content.¬† Netflix says users will not be able to change this setting if they have any pending downloads. Cancel them, and then try again or wait for them to finish.With automatic settings for mobile data usage, Netflix does around 4 hours of streaming per GB of data. The save data setting, brings down consumption per GB to around six hours of streaming on Netflix. The maximum data setting streams at the highest possible level and uses nearly one GB per 20 minutes or more. It would be best to change it if this is the level right now on your devices.Amazon Prime Video also lists out the amount of data used when streaming at different quality options. The service uses around 0.38GB data per hour with a good quality setting, for better it rises to 1.48GB per hour. The best quality setting consumes nearly 6.84 GB per hour.

https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/coronavirus-outbreak-testing-the-whatsapp-chatbots-by-who-and-indian-government-6329630/,Coronavirus pandemic: We checked out the WhatsApp chatbots by WHO and Indian government,2020-03-25 15:52:28+05:30,"While the government is trying to contain the spread of the coronavirus pandemic, fake news peddlers are busy spreading misinformation regarding the COVID-19 disease. WhatsApp has partnered with the World Health Organisation and the Indian government to launch two chatbots in order to provide authentic information about the coronavirus.The MyGov Corona Help Desk chatbot for the Indian WhatsApp user has been developed by Jio Haptik Technologies Limited and powered by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare together with the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology.The chatbot developed by WHO provides global information regarding the COViD-19 outbreak and is simply known as the ‚ÄúWorld Health Organization‚Äù.The MyGov Corona Helpdesk can be accessed by adding +91-9013-151515 to your contacts and sending a message or by following this link: wa.me/919013151515. The WHO chatbot can be accessed by adding +41-7989-31892 to your contacts and sending a message or by following this link: bit.ly/who-covid19-whatsapp. I tried both of these chatbots and here is what I found:The MyGov chatbot introduces itself as ‚Äúthe Government of India‚Äôs Coronavirus (COVID-19) Helpdesk to create awareness and help you and your family stay safe‚Äù and straight up shares the emergency helpline number and email address for the Indian users.The chatbot has six options in total:1. Latest Update on Coronavirus in India
2. What is Coronavirus and what are its symptoms?
3. How does Coronavirus spread?
4. How to reduce the risk of Coronavirus?
5. Professional advice by AIIMS-Director
6. Where to get help?Users need to reply with the number written against a query to make the selection.When I pressed 1, the chatbot informed me about the confirmed cases of coronavirus in the country along with active cases, cured or discharged cases, and the number of deaths by COVID-19. However, the information with chatbot does not refresh too often. Even at 3:45 pm in the evening, it continued to show stats from 10:30 am in the morning.In the same message, the MyGov Corona Helpdesk shared the number of testing facilities in the country, along with a link to a document containing state and district wise details of COVID-19 cases. It also had links to the MyGov website and MOHFW website.The response from the chatbot also carried the latest announcement made by the government related to the coronavirus outbreak. In the morning, it shared the lockdown announcement and around 3 pm, it shared information about the Prime Minister‚Äôs address to the nation scheduled at 8 pm.For other responses, the chatbot presented useful information regarding symptoms, spread of disease, and health tips with the help of YouTube videos, graphical pamphlets, and more. It also shared links to videos by Director, AIIMS-Delhi to learn and clear doubts on coronavirus. This can be particularly useful given so many fake videos of ‚Äòdoctors‚Äô are being shared on WhatsApp.If you press 6, the chatbot shares helpline numbers again with an option to view state-wise helpline numbers.The MyGov chatbot and WHO chatbot are not that different, but the latter is aimed at a much wider audience. It presents users with eight options and users need to send the number written before a query to get the information.The WHO chatbot gives you ‚Äúlatest numbers‚Äù of coronavirus patients from around the world as well as new cases reported in the last 24 hours. You can also check country numbers by tapping on the link shared by the chatbot. The chatbot also lists out COVID-19 symptoms together with advisories to ‚Äúprotect yourself‚Äù.It also shares ‚Äúmyth-busters‚Äù as well as ‚Äútravel advice‚Äù. I would urge readers to see these myth-busters in particular, and share them on WhatsApp considering this is authenticated information.With WHO chatbot, users can get the latest news updates shared by the WHO with just a tap. My favourite part of this chatbot was the third option‚Äî ‚ÄúYour questions answered‚Äù. Once you complete all the question-answers, you will feel like an expert on the subject leaving no doubt for any confusion.

The three-wheeled robot can carry food, medical and clinical consumables and navigate freely in the hospitals. The robot has been developed in 15 days by a team of seven people.‚ÄúIt is impractical to deploy human-like robots in hospitals. This is why we are working on a cost-effective model which is very practical at this point,‚Äù Jayakrishnan T, CEO of Asimov Robotics told indianexpress.com on phone.Jayakrishnan said the robot is mainly designed to be used inside isolation wards. The robot, dubbed ‚ÄúKARMI-BOT‚Äù, has lower and upper trays that can be loaded with food or sterile containers. Additionally, the robot also disinfects the used items as it comes out of the quarantine zone. The robot also lets doctors or relatives interact with the patients through video calling.Jayakrishnan said the robot has autonomous navigation and can be used remotely as well. The advantage of deploying a robot in this scenario is to cut down on human to human contact. This will help both health workers and visitors.Express Tech is now on Telegram. Click here to join our channel (@expresstechnology) and stay updated with the latest tech newsThe robot is currently being tested internally and fine-tuned at the lab. ‚ÄúIf spares are ready, we can make one robot per day with the current facility itself,‚Äù he said.Jayakrishnan said the interest in the robot is increasing, even though the product has not been out yet. The company has been talking to clients in the US and the Middle East. However, Jayakrishnan is aware that to meet the demand, the firm needs to set up a production line and expand the facility which may take some lead time. For now, though the company wants to focus on the domestic market and its home state.Jayakrishnan declined to reveal how much it costs to make the KARMI-BOT, but said it will be cheaper to produce than the existing robots. ‚Äú US clients are specifically interested in non-Chinese products, which is an advantage for us. Our ultimate aim is to load it with features and bring the cost below Chinese competitors,‚Äù he said.Asimov Robotics, which is incubated within the Kerala Startup Mission, is one of the few high-tech robotics companies from India that focuses on healthcare.‚ÄúOur robots are connected and not standalone products. The robots are connected to the distributed sensor network and use AI and MI to come to a decision and based on that decision, they respond,‚Äù he explains.In China, many hospitals have deployed high-tech robots to deliver food to patients, take patients‚Äô temperatures, deliver medication and disinfect the facility. Similarly, the Spanish government is planning to test 80,000 patients a day using robots in a bid to fight the pandemic.Earlier this month, Jayakrishnan and his team deployed two humanoid robots at the entrance of Maker Village at the Kinfra Hi-Tech Park in Kalamassery to create awareness about the coronavirus outbreak and distribute masks and sanitisers to people who work in the Integrated Startup Complex.Jayakrishnan is also working on a realistic humanoid robot similar to Sophia. The robot, called Chhaya, is able to converse, understand and synthesise expressions.üì£ The Indian Express is now on Telegram.

According to the instructions, he should have gotten a text message with a unique pin for activation of the tracking app once home.But Wong, who hasn‚Äôt left his home, only received a text message after 24 hours had passed. When he tried to activate the app by scanning the QR code and inputting the pin, he got an error message.Wong tried calling the Office of the Government Chief Information Officer, which created the system, but the line was either busy or the person who answered couldn‚Äôt provide assistance. Wong‚Äôs friend who flew back with him encountered the same problem.The Office of the Government Chief Information Officer said in an emailed statement that a small number of people had been unable to receive text messages because of incomplete or incorrect phone numbers on quarantine-order forms. Hong Kong‚Äôs Department of Health plans to follow up on any cases of activation failure, according to the statement.Wong‚Äôs wristband is one of around 24,000 tracker bracelets the government has distributed to monitor new arrivals. The band is meant to connect to an app that sends out alerts asking the person to take pictures of themselves wearing the wristband, and issues warnings if it senses the person had left their place of residence. The device detects and analyzes radio signals, including Bluetooth and wifi, as well as geographical location signals when it‚Äôs activated.Mandatory self-isolation is one of the policies being taken in Hong Kong to curb the spread of Covid-19. The city‚Äôs Chief Executive Carrie Lam on Monday announced the government will also ban all foreign travellers from entering the city for 14 days and prevent bars from serving alcohol.Charmaine Man, a 24-year-old working in film production, is another person affected by the wristband issue. She hasn‚Äôt received any text message since returning to Hong Kong from Malaysia on Saturday. Even though she plans to stay at home for the entire isolation period, she‚Äôs worried about any potential legal risk due to the system‚Äôs failure.‚ÄúThis is a mandatory quarantine, but when I can‚Äôt activate the app, will they consider I‚Äôm breaking the law?‚ÄùScores of people in Facebook groups have also reported the same problem, while there have been photos and videos of people taking their quarantine wristbands on public transport.üì£ The Indian Express is now on Telegram.

However, it turned out to be a brief affair of events as the mini-moon left the planet‚Äôs orbit.2020 CD3 was first discovered on February 15 using the NASA-funded Catalina Sky Survey observatory in Arizona. According to the astronomers, the object may have entered Earth‚Äôs orbit three years ago. Bill Gray, an astronomy-software developer, told the Atlantic that the 2020 CD3 likely left our orbit on March 7.

https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/cognovi-panic-index-shows-how-sentiment-on-jobs-spiked-after-coronavirus-was-declared-pandemic-6329321/,Cognovi Panic Index shows how sentiment on jobs spiked after coronavirus was declared pandemic,2020-03-25 17:35:25+05:30,"How does a pandemic impact human sentiments? The Panic Index created by Cognovi Labs, a US-based AI and predictive behavioral analytics company, has shown that in US people‚Äôs fears around employment shot up from 24 to 64 as soon as coronavirus was declared a pandemic and the United States restricted travel from Europe.The Cognovi ‚ÄúPanic Index‚Äù measures people‚Äôs emotional response towards Covid-19 in realtime and it‚Äôs impact on stock markets, dining, shopping, travel and other economic activities. The Dayton, Ohio startup takes advantage of Twitris, a Wright State University-developed machine learning tool, to take a sample of social media happenings about Covid 19 and use a combination of human, machine learning and understanding of behavioral psychology to interpret the conversation and then extract sentiments about what they are searching for in real-time.‚ÄúThis [technology] extracts emotions from free-flowing conversations‚Ä¶maybe any social media chatter if people are posting on blogs or forums or Twitter and it extracts the emotions from that ideally short-form text. It‚Äôs probably the best tool and has the highest capability of extracting emotions of any tool in the world that we‚Äôve seen,‚Äù Colin Butler, Global Revenue Officer, Cognovi Labs, told Indianexpress.com in a telephonic interview.The tool fetches a mix of emotional and non-emotional words based on searches related to the event. For example, in India, Cognovi Labs is relying on the data available on Twitter. These searches can be different from country to country and state to state. As the data updates in real-time, the Cognovi Panic Index shows a different picture of that event, based on people‚Äôs emotional sentiments.Express Tech is now on Telegram. Click here to join our channel (@expresstechnology) and stay updated with the latest tech news‚ÄúThe baseline of the technology is that extracts the emotion and once you have the emotions, we use a proprietary appraisal theory to understand how those emotions combine to predict future action,‚Äù he continues.The decision to create the Cognovi ‚ÄúPanic Index‚Äù was taken a few days ago. ‚ÄúThe index, we created, measures the public‚Äôs emotional state over the coronavirus. Through a dashboard, we can see how the emotionality heats up in different geographical areas. And since people make decisions based on emotions, as the fear heats up, you really understand what the population‚Äôs predilection is towards a certain behavior or maybe how they actually feel about a certain topic,‚Äù he explains.Butler believes that the vast majority of decisions that humans make are based on the subconscious mind and not the logical mind. ‚ÄúIf you are able to extract emotions somehow, you get a predictive window into behavior of people,‚Äù he said. Cognovi Labs has in the past successfully predicted the Brexit referendum hours before the polls closed as well as the results of the 2016 U.S. presidential elections.The core to the machine learning tool, which Cognovi Labs uses to extract emotions from social media chatter and quantifies human behavior to predict the outcome of events, was developed by co-founder Dr Amit Sheth at the Kno.e.sis Center at Wright State University.Cognovi Labs‚Äô AI technology, which took eight years to develop, was funded by the US Air Force, the National Science Foundation, and the Department of Energy. According to Butler, Cognovi Labs has a perpetual and exclusive license to use the technology.Investors of Cognovi Labs include Harvard Business School Alumni Angels of Greater New York, the Ikove Start-up Nursery Fund out of Columbus, and Bossa Nova Capital in Brazil, among others.Butler, who was previously head of business development at a hedge fund and an investment banker with over 20 years experience on Wall Street, says Cognovi Labs‚Äô Emotion AI technology can help governments, corporations, advertisers, marketers and retailers to tweak their future strategies based on people‚Äôs emotions at the time of a pandemic like Covid-19 or any political event.üì£ The Indian Express is now on Telegram.

https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/mobile-tabs/iphone-12-pro-max-what-is-sensor-shift-stabilization-and-how-does-it-work-6329041/,iPhone 12 Pro Max: What is sensor-shift image stabilization and how does it work?,2020-03-26 17:10:32+05:30,"Most high-end camera smartphones, including the iPhone 11 Pro Max, come with OIS or Optical Image Stabilization. The tech has been used in smartphones for quite some time.¬†However, Apple‚Äôs upcoming iPhone 12 Pro Max, might be the first smartphone to feature the new sensor-shift stabilization instead of lens-based optical image stabilization.
Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo believes the iPhone 12 Pro Max would benefit from the brand new sensor-shift image stabilization technology when it launches later this year. But what is Sensor-shift image stabilization and what‚Äôs makes it superior to OIS? Let‚Äôs find out.Image stabilization is a common term used in photography. Simply put, Image stabilization (or IS) enables photographers to take blur-free images or videos without a tripod. Any camera with a built-in image stabilization allows you to shoot at slower shutter speeds than one without, delivering a noise-free and sharper image. There are different kinds of Image Stabilization but we stick to sensor-shift image stabilization and optical image stabilization.The Sensor-shift image stabilisation system or IBIS (In-Body Image Stabilization) incorporates a floating sensor that helps counterbalance any movement within the camera. If your camera has IBIS, all of the lenses will also have image stabilization. In-Body Image Stabilization has become popular among the high-end mirrorless camera. A lot of Sony, Fuji and Olympus cameras feature In-body image stabilization. IBIS currently works with interchangeable lens cameras and has yet to launch on smartphones.Express Tech is now on Telegram. Click here to join our channel (@expresstechnology) and stay updated with the latest tech newsAs opposed to inside the camera, OIS uses the phone‚Äôs gyroscope and tiny motors to shift the camera‚Äôs lens or sensor. What‚Äôs interesting with OIS is that the image is stabilized before it reaches the sensor, so there is no loss of quality in image quality. This allows the autofocus to function more accurately. Nokia Lumia 920 was the first smartphone to feature OIS.The difference in image quality isn‚Äôt drastic, but the good thing about SSIS is that it can be combined with any lens. That means if Apple manages to bring SSIS to the iPhone 12 Pro Max, all the three lenses would be stabilized. The iPhone 11 Pro‚Äôs ultra-wide-angle lens, for instance, is not stabilized.

The tech firms have not disclosed any financial impact from the outbreak so far.‚ÄúThis is not going to be business as usual, and the marketing industry is certainly going to see a real impact. I don‚Äôt think anyone knows how big. So we‚Äôre going to watch and look,‚Äù Facebook Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg told Bloomberg TV last week.There are positive signs for the internet giants, though.Hyundai, Toyota and GM were among automakers who started to run online ads last week directly or indirectly mentioning how they were adjusting practices because of the coronavirus, according to commercials seen by Reuters.The warning from Twitter comes two weeks after it reached an agreement with Elliott Management that allowed Jack Dorsey to stay on as chief executive and added three new directors.As part of the agreement, Twitter had pledged to grow daily users by 20% or more in 2020 and beyond, roughly in line with user growth in its fourth quarter.Twitter said on Monday total monetizable daily active users (mDAU) jumped 23% to 164 million quarter-to-date, driven by the conversation around COVID-19, as well as ongoing product improvements.‚ÄúWe‚Äôre seeing a meaningful increase in people using Twitter,‚Äù Dorsey said.The company said it expects first-quarter revenue to be down slightly on a year-over-year basis. It had earlier estimated revenue to be between $825 million and $885 million, an 8.6% rise from a year earlier at the midpoint.The company is scheduled to announce its results on April 30.üì£ The Indian Express is now on Telegram.

At least 75 districts across India were under lockdown to tackle the coronavirus that has infected 415 people and killed seven in the country with health experts warning a big jump could be imminent.Though India‚Äôs Ministry of Consumer Affairs had urged states to allow some e-commerce deliveries to ensure essential supplies, different state notifications created confusion and have marred operations.China‚Äôs Alibaba Group-backed online grocery firm BigBasket said it faced disruptions in many cities as police were not fully aware of certain exemptions announced by state governments for grocery deliveries and had stopped some of BigBasket‚Äôs delivery staff from operating.‚ÄùWe hope things will improve soon,‚Äù said senior BigBasket executive Hari T.N., who urged governments to intervene to allow seamless grocery deliveries in the country.Japan‚Äôs SoftBank-backed grocery firm Grofers warehouses in cities such as Hyderabad, Mumbai, Pune and New Delhi have been ‚Äúforced (into) lockdown‚Äù, said CEO Albinder Dhindsa.Similar delivery or warehouse disruptions hit Amazon, Walmart‚Äôs Flipkart and Softbank-backed e-commerce website Snapdeal across states, industry executives said.The full extent of the disruptions was not immediately clear.Flipkart said there were ‚Äúoperational issues on ground‚Äù and it was working with governments to resolve them while Snapdeal said uniform implementation of the federal advisory would help reduce disruption for buyers.Amazon said it was working with local authorities to ensure goods arrive safely and without disruptions at clients‚Äô homes.

This has also meant that many companies now have to close down manufacturing units in view of the lockdown orders.Samsung, which has its largest factory in Noida, has confirmed it will be suspending manufacturing. It has also implemented work from home for employees. ‚ÄúAt Samsung, health and safety of employees is our highest priority. As a measure to safeguard our employees and their families against Covid-19 and in compliance with directives from the government, we have decided to currently suspend our manufacturing operations and have asked employees at our sales, marketing and R&D offices across India to work from home,‚Äù Partha Ghosh, Head, Corporate Communications, Samsung India said in a statement.Other players like Oppo and vivo have also reportedly suspended their manufacturing operations, though the latter has not issued a formal statement.‚ÄúSafety of our employees is of utmost priority at OPPO. Keeping the recent outbreak of coronavirus in mind, a host of preventive measures have already been undertaken. Operations in our Greater Noida factory have been suspended as per the directive from the government. Additionally, all OPPO India employees have been advised to work from home until further notice. Our travel advisory is already in play and traveling interstate has been postponed for all employees. Currently, all OPPO employees are in good health and we are complying with guidelines of state and central government to control the epidemic and ensure safety of all OPPO staff,‚Äù Oppo said in a statement.We also reached out to Xiaomi on whether its manufacturing would be impacted, and a company spokesperson said that ‚Äúeach facility such as corporate office, warehouse, Service center, Mi Home, Manufacturing plant will abide by the lockdown orders issued by the state and UTs.‚Äù Xiaomi relies on third-party contractor manufacturers for its manufacturing in India.Realme has also suspended its manufacturing operations in Greater Noida since March 21, according to a statement from the company. The company said it was diligently complying with Government directives and advisories and is taking necessary precautions to ensure employee safety and well-being.‚ÄúWhile this will temporarily affect our inventory and supply in the market for some time, the safety of our workforce is of paramount importance to us. The company will resume manufacturing only after government‚Äôs notice while ensuring safety measures of all employees,‚Äù the statement added. The company also said the upcoming online launch of realme Narzo series was pre-recorded, while taking necessary measures to provide all staff and workers with a safe and healthy environment.The closing of manufacturing units will definitely have a negative impact on the Indian smartphone market. ‚ÄúWe are expecting a major slump in consumer demand till June at least and demand is likely to shift towards the second half, especially festive season,‚Äù Tarun Pathak, Associate Director at Counterpoint Research said in a comment to indianexpress.com. He said the move was anyway expected and practical given the situation now.The analyst also cautioned that the ‚Äúsecond half recovery will be linked to the economic impact of the COVID-19‚Äù.

We are expecting April and May will be hard and it all depends on how measures we are taking now impact the overall flattening of curve.‚Äù‚ÄúThe outlook doesn‚Äôt seem very positive for second quarter. March would be impacted significantly as well. But the second quarter will be impacted both in terms of sell ins and now demand as well.

https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/online-dating-in-a-pandemic-coronavirus-keeps-singles-apart-6328173/,Online dating in a pandemic: Coronavirus keeps singles apart,2020-03-23 18:41:20+05:30,"By Olivia Carville and Nate LanxonStephane, a 32-year-old financier in Manhattan, recently updated his Bumble profile to read: ‚ÄúHealthy male with a strong immune system and robust Purell supply.‚Äù He got a quick reply from a New York woman, who fired back a private message: ‚ÄúTell me your secret‚Äîhow did you get a robust Purell supply? I had to fight a woman at the grocery store for a can of tuna.‚Äù While it was good to hear from another human being, Stephane never responded. Because, well, Covid-19.The novel coronavirus that causes the malady has infected more than 200,000 people around the world and ushered in a fraught new era of online dating. Millennials, trapped under indefinite work-from-home policies and banned from bars, are on dating apps‚Äîswiping, texting, flirting‚Äîmore so than before. Active users rose 8% on Bumble during the second week of March in the US, according to App Annie, which tracks downloads. The big question is how long that will last now that courting in the real world is basically verboten.Dating apps typically run on a freemium model, providing basic services without charge in the hopes that customers will pay more for extra features, such as unveiling who has swiped right on you or applying more granular filters to narrow the dating pool. As social distancing guidelines are rolled out across the US and Europe, dating apps are betting more people will sign up and pay extra to find love‚Äîeven if it‚Äôs virtual for the time being.The bullish view on Wall Street is that users will be willing to spend more time and money on dating apps because they‚Äôve got nothing better to do. The bearish take is they‚Äôll stop paying for extra services because the thought of being within breathing distance of a stranger is more scary than sexy.This month, Brent Thill, an analyst with Jeffries, cut his annual revenue growth forecast from 16% to 9% for Match Group Inc., which owns some of the most popular dating apps in the world including Tinder, OkCupid and Hinge. The shares have fallen 30% over the past month, in line with the S&P 500 Index. ‚ÄúThe big challenge right now is, who wants to go on a date with someone they don‚Äôt know,‚Äù Thill says. ‚ÄúIf I was single, I wouldn‚Äôt want to date anyone right now.‚ÄùNo one really knows how to responsibly date in a pandemic. Some apps are advising couples to meet in open spaces and avoid any form of physical contact; others are suggesting a safer, more sanitary solution: phone sex.‚ÄúWe know it can be a drag being cooped up inside, but there are lots of other ways to have fun: sexting or phone/video sex are great ways to get hot without getting sick,‚Äù the dating app #Open, aimed at couples in open relationships, sent in a message to its 50,000 users on Monday. ‚ÄúThis isn‚Äôt a good time to be swapping spit.‚ÄùLast week, New York Mayor Bill de Blasio was asked how daters should respond to the disaster. That question ‚Äúgoes to the heart of the matter,‚Äù de Blasio said, adding that people cannot get to a point of hopelessness right now. ‚ÄúI do think it‚Äôs fine to have a social life, but you‚Äôve got to exercise some smart rules. If you‚Äôre sick, don‚Äôt go on a date. If the date is sick, don‚Äôt go on the date.‚Äù He suggested keeping a little more distance and said it would be wise even to refrain from kissing one another on the cheek. On Sunday, physically dating in the Big Apple became near impossible as officials closed down restaurants, bars and movie theaters as well as urging residents to stick to strict social distancing guidelines.‚ÄúPeople are feeling isolated, particularly those who are single and can‚Äôt go home to their parents and families,‚Äù says Jordana Abraham, co-founder of Ship, a dating app that allows friends to swipe on behalf of its users. ‚ÄúThey are physically isolated, but not socially isolated.‚ÄùShip says group chat messages exploded 60% nationwide in the past week. Group messages first started ramping up in Seattle when social distancing rules were enforced. They skyrocketed in New York shortly after similar rules were put in place‚Äîwith messages more than doubling in frequency in the past seven days alone.OkCupid has also reported surging engagement and messaging among millennials. People are talking more through the app‚Äîand they are talking about coronavirus. OkCupid saw a 188% increase in coronavirus mentions on dating profiles between January and February. People being people, cringeworthy virus pickup lines are starting to proliferate. As in: ‚ÄúAre you the coronavirus? Because you take my breath away.‚Äù And random hookups are fast being replaced with weeks-long virtual courting, complete with cootie paranoia and forced chivalry.You know who‚Äôs really gonna suffer during this social distancing?Dudes on dating appsWelcome back to courtship, Brad. Welcome back to talking to a gal for WEEKS prior to meeting.We‚Äôre pen pals now, my dude.We bout to get Jane Austen up in here.Now, write me a poem.‚Äî Kaitlyn McQuin (@kaitlynmcquin) March 15, 2020The coronavirus itself even has a mock dating profile, which tells users its hometown is Wuhan, China‚Äîthe epicentre of the outbreak‚Äîand that its major turn-offs are face masks and doctors.Match hasn‚Äôt yet revised its forecasts. The Dallas-based company is monitoring the situation ‚Äúbut can‚Äôt comment definitively on what impact we are seeing,‚Äù a company spokesperson says. Its star performer, Tinder, is also mum on member activity. However, the app, synonymous with a ‚Äúhookup culture‚Äù on college campuses, is urging users to be cautious. ‚ÄúWhile we want you to continue to have fun, protecting yourself from the coronavirus is more important,‚Äù Tinder told to its 5.9 million global subscribers, advising that they wash their hands frequently, carry hand sanitizer, avoid touching their faces and maintain social distance in public.Amsterdam-based The Inner Circle was created for working professionals willing to pay a premium to attend exclusive events, such as cocktail-making classes, jazz nights and ski trips, to meet verified matches. Co-founder Michael Krayenhoff says the virus has presented a wholly unromantic dilemma for the business. ‚ÄúWe had to make a decision as a company to cancel all our events and refund everyone,‚Äù he says.As the pandemic worsened, Inner Circle members began turning to phone calls and video chats. During the first week of March, they were exchanging phone numbers and sending messages about ‚ÄúFaceTime‚Äù and ‚ÄúSkype‚Äù about 30% more often than a month earlier. This led the company to actively promote virtual dating ideas like ‚ÄúSelf-Isolate and Chill,‚Äù a play on ‚ÄúNetflix and chill,‚Äù a euphemism for sex. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs about two people putting on the same television program at the same time, then calling to talk about it as they watch,‚Äù Krayenhoff says. ‚ÄúI think that has something very exciting or romantic to it.‚ÄùLGBTQ dating service Grindr published a notice to users on its app advising them to follow World Health Organization best practices. ‚ÄúThe health and safety of our users is a top priority for Grindr,‚Äù a spokesperson says. Bumble, a dating app where women make the first move, has also been trying to educate its members. Last week, it published a blog post written by Stanford University epidemiologist Seema Yasmin about how to date during a pandemic. ‚ÄúYour best bet would be to meet in a public place that isn‚Äôt too busy, like a park, and stay three to six feet apart,‚Äù Yasmin wrote. ‚ÄúIf you turn up to find your date coughing and looking unwell, you can advise them to practice good cough hygiene then politely get out of there.‚Äùüì£ The Indian Express is now on Telegram.

https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/social/likee-330-million-downloads-short-video-app-tiktok-6328117/,Likee reaches 330 million downloads: What does this short video app offer?,2020-03-23 18:16:27+05:30,"The popularity of TikTok, Likee, VMate and other similar apps leave no doubt about the rising popularity of short video apps. The entry of Google in this space with Tangi app and Instagram‚Äôs decision to roll out a similar feature with Instagram Reels only reaffirms the situation. These apps have created sort of a parallel social media space where videos drive the user interest‚Äì a feat once achieved by Vine with its 6.5-sec video loops.While the future of Vine did not turn out to be fortunate, TikTok and others are still going strong. Earlier, we talked about VMate and this time around we are taking a look at Likee‚Äì a short video platform that registered 208 per cent yearly increase to boast of 115 million monthly active users. The platform also garnered 330 million downloads globally in 2019, with India driving more than half of these installs.Likee claims that its user base in India comprises of people from metro cities, as well as from tier 2 and tier 3 cities. I tried the application and here is what I found.Likee, formerly Like Video, is a ‚Äúglobal short video creation platform‚Äù and it looks no different than the other similar platforms‚Äì at least on the first instance. However, I found the interface of the app a bit more simplistic and easier to navigate than its peers, which might not mean much the usual smartphone user but people who aren‚Äôt tech-savvy probably appreciate it.Aside from the infinitely-long video feed, Likee also comes with a Live feature like the BIGO app. This bit is understandable because Likee is owned by Singapore-based BIGO. Just like the BIGO Live, Likee also allows users to send virtual gifts and roses to their favourite creators.I did not witness objectionable content over the live feeds. Also, it feels reassuring to see a parental control feature on Likee that filters content for young users.Likee also comes with a News tab, which looks like a half-baked attempt. All you see here are video clips that don‚Äôt necessarily fall in the news category and the source of these clips are the usual Likee users.I could spot several media outlets on the app that were posting real short video clips for the news of the day. I personally feel that Likee should reach out to more media outlets to fill its News tab‚Äì which, at the moment, looks a bit unrefined.On Likee, there is support for 15 Indian languages, including Tamil, Telugu, Marathi, Gujarati, Urdu and Sanskrit.Talking about the unique features on the app, BIGO Technology‚Äôs Vice President Mike Ong said, ‚ÄúWe also have a unique feature called ‚ÄòSuperme‚Äô, which enables users to create videos using photos in their gallery. It comes with different features and themes such as creative, morph, dramatic, face cut and festival. Another similar significant feature is the ‚ÄòFace Magic Feature‚Äô, which allows users to have fun by morphing a celebrity face in any of their favourite dance/movie scenes with their own face to create engaging videos.‚ÄùExpress Tech is now on¬†Telegram.

Most major Indian cities are under lockdown, and work from home has become the norm, but it comes with its own benefits and headaches. While the stress of commuting might have disappeared for sometime, many of us have new worries to deal about when working from home. There‚Äôs the issue of internet connectivity, office VPNs slowing down speeds, along with the distractions of social media and other services.One must also factor in that since there is a lockdown, many of us are constantly scrolling some screen or other, be it the phone or desktop or even the smart TV in the living room. Since we can no longer leave our homes, the screen inevitably becomes the only source of entertainment, and it might be a good time to put some restrictions in place so that you can at least focus on other activities to keep yourself distracted.We look at the tools you can rely on for screen management available on Android and iOS devices, along with other apps that can be useful during this period.Google introduced the ‚ÄòDigital Wellbeing‚Äô feature with Android Pie and it is available on most smartphones now. This is one of the most useful tools to restrict your usage of certain apps, and helps you gain some control if you are too addicted to the phone.The Digital Wellbeing feature can be found in the settings apps on Google Pixel phones, and any other device running Android Pie and above, including popular phones from Samsung, Redmi, Realme, and other brands.You can go to Digital Wellbeing in the Settings app of your smartphone and set up the Dashboard to put a time limit on each of your apps. So if you feel you are spending too much time scrolling on Facebook or Instagram, you can see a timer. Once the timer is set and you exceed the daily limit for the day, Android will then block your access to the app. The lowest limit you can set is 5 minutes, going up all the way to 24 hours.Of course, there is the option of resetting the timer, and regaining access, but one advantage with the dashboard is that you can screen out some of these apps during your work day, so you are not distracted by these during the designated work hours. Once you are done with the day, you can go to Settings and reset the timer to gain some more access should you wish to do so.The good thing with Google‚Äôs Digital Wellbeing feature is that you can individually put a limit on each app. So if you feel you are spending too much time on Netflix or Instagram, you can restrict them individually.Read our others tips regarding work from home and internet connectivityInternet not working properly? How to check the speed and fix it | Boosting your WiFi signal strength |¬† Download these video calling apps if you‚Äôre working from homeAnother feature of Digital Wellbeing which might be useful in these stressful times is the Wind Down. This will implement a Night schedule from a select time period, say 10 pm to 6 am in the morning and ensure your phone does not keep buzzing with notifications. The screen goes to a grayscale, which is easier on the eyes, and Do Not Disturb (DND) mode is turned on automatically during this time.There‚Äôs also a Focus Mode, which will pause distracting apps when you need to focus during a fixed period. So you can set a schedule, say during your work hours and choose apps that should be locked down. During that period, Android will stop access to these apps, the icon will get greyed out till focus mode is on. This can be beneficial if you find games, social media apps distracting during work hours.Apple‚Äôs iOS and MacOS users also have the option of introducing limits on their apps with Screen Time, which was introduced with iOS 12. This will let you choose restrictions for apps based on categories, unlike Android which has options for individual apps.Screen Time lets you set limits for Social networking, Games, Entertainment, Creativity, Productivity apps, and on websites as well. The only problem is that sometimes apps that get tagged in a category might not really be used for that purpose. One example is WhatsApp, which will be tagged under social networking, but many offices might be using it to coordinate. So you might find some apps get locked out, even though you want access to them all day.But there is a solution. In the Always Allowed segment, you can go down and choose Apps for which you do not want any downtime or locking out.Another useful feature is Downtime, which you can customise. During this time, only apps that you choose are allowed and phone calls will be available. You can customise it for days of the week.There is also the option of Communication Limits, which might be particularly useful if you need to set some boundaries for after work hour calls, which can be an issue during work from home. During the downtime, you can ensure that Phone calls, Messages, FaceTime requests are restricted to specific contacts. Screen Time is also available on macOS, though you will have to set it up separately on the MacBook.For those who want to go beyond the standard default options available on the devices, there are apps to offer this kind of control as well. Freedom is one such app, which is available on iOS, Android, MacOS and Windows 10 as well. But it is not free, and you get only seven free sessions. After that the service costs $6.99 per month or $2.42/month if you get it for one year, There‚Äôs also a $129 offer for forever, though right now it is retailing at $64.50 as part of a discount.With Freedom, you can start a session and block all distracting websites and apps on your PC or MacBook while working. You can set the duration for how long these should be blocked, and it will ensure greater focus when you are working from home. You can set the duration for each session and the site will be blocked for that period.App Detox is for those of you who are still on older versions of Android, or find that the Digital Wellbeing feature is not enough to help you. The app will let you choose apps from which you want a detox, and will let you decide from specific daytimes on specific days to number of launches to usage time for a particular app.It will also let you decide if you want to stay away from an app for a number of days. There‚Äôs also the more drastic, ‚ÄòFOREVER‚Äô option, if you decide you don‚Äôt want to use this app again. This is only available on Android.Moment is an app on iOS users for those who need more and Screen Time is just not helping. So when setting up the phone it will ask you what you want to do be it track screen time to stop wasting time to reduce anxiety. There‚Äôs also a Moment Coach to help you use the phone less, though it will cost Rs 689 per month. The app also has courses, though you need to subscribe into order to access these features.Here‚Äôs a quick coronavirus guide for you to stay updated: Who all should be tested for Covid-19 and when? | How should you quarantine yourself? | How often (and how) should you clean your home? | What is the Janata Curfew announced by PM Modi? | Who are restricted from coming to India, and from when? | How long can the virus live on surfaces or in air around you? | Still more Coronavirus Q&A Explained news here

Due to this internet consumption has gone up drastically given people are either playing games or watching movies or making video calls with friends and family members living far away. People are also depending a lot on OTT platforms for entertainment.Streaming services like Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, and some others have reduced their video quality in order to offer a smooth viewing experience at least during the lockdown period. There are a lot of streaming services available in India and a person who‚Äôs new to OTT platforms might get on about which one to opt for. To make it simple and easy for people to select streaming services and plans that suit them the best we have created a list of all the popular streaming services available in India, and explained how much they cost and the benefits they offer.Netflix is comparatively the most expensive streaming service platform currently available in India. The cheapest plan is priced at Rs 199, however, it only allows you to watch content on your phone or tablet, one screen at a time in SD quality. The Basic plan costs Rs 499, which allows streaming at one screen at a time in SD quality. The Rs 649 Standard plan users are allowed to stream via two screens in HD quality. Lastly, under the Premium plan, which costs Rs 799 offers customers to be logged in to four screens at a time in UHD quality.Hotstar is one of the most subscribed to streaming services in India. The company currently offers customers two types of subscription plans: Hotstar Premium and Hotstar VIP. The VIP plan which allows customers to stream sporting events along with all of Hotstar‚Äôs own content. Then there is the Premium pack, under which the users can stream everything on the platform. The Premium Pack has two sub categories a monthly plan priced at Rs 299 per month and a yearly plan priced at Rs 999 per year.Amazon Prime Video is a streaming service that provides consumers with more than what they get in other streaming services offer. It offers consumers with free music streaming and free delivery benefits. As of now, Amazon only offers a single Prime member subscription with two tiers: monthly, which is priced at Rs 129 and yearly, which is priced at Rs 999.YouTube Premium has its own original shows, but most of them are international shows. Regional premium content is very low, but the content that it has is very engaging. Moreover, Premium customers do not have to watch any sorts of ads and also get access to the YouTube Music service. It is priced at Rs 129 per month and at Rs 399 for three months for single users. Family users who want to add up to five members need to pay Rs 189 per month.

It also offers its users multiple free cashback offers with its subscription plans.Many only remember MX Player as a video player that could play the .mkv file format and had a slew of controls. Well, it is not the same now, as it has expanded and provides users with syndicated content along with its own originals. Also, a benefit this has is that it is completely free of cost with users not needing to pay even a single penny. But, due to it being free, the service does show ads in between consuming content.Voot was earlier a free of cost streaming platform, however, the company has recently changed that and is now offering customers premium content at a subscription cost of Rs 99 per month and at Rs 999 per year. However, it has not turned over to a fully paid platform as it still consists of free ad-supported content.üì£ The Indian Express is now on Telegram.

Called the COVID-19 CTI League, for cyber threat intelligence, the group spans more than 40 countries and includes professionals in senior positions at such major companies as Microsoft Corp and Amazon.com Inc.One of four initial managers of the effort, Marc Rogers, said the top priority would be working to combat hacks against medical facilities and other frontline responders to the pandemic. It is already working on hacks of health organizations. Also key is the defence of communication networks and services that have become essential as more people work from home, said Rogers, head of security at the long-running hacking conference Def Con and a vice president at security company Okta Inc.The group is also using its web of contacts in internet infrastructure providers to squash garden-variety phishing attacks and another financial crime that is using the fear of COVID-19 or the desire for information on it to trick regular internet users.‚ÄúI‚Äôve never seen this volume of phishing,‚Äù Rogers said. ‚ÄúI am literally seeing phishing messages in every language known to man.‚ÄùPhishing messages try to induce recipients to enter passwords or other sensitive information on websites controlled by the attackers, who then use the data to take control of bank, email or other accounts. Rogers said the group had already dismantled one campaign that used a software vulnerability to spread malicious software. He declined to provide details, and said that in general the group would be reluctant to reveal what it was fighting.Rogers said law enforcement had been surprisingly welcoming of the collaboration, recognising the vastness of the threat. Rogers is a UK citizen based in the San Francisco Bay Area. Two other group coordinators are American, and one is Israeli.‚ÄúI have never seen this level of cooperation,‚Äù Rogers said. ‚ÄúI hope it continues afterwards, because it‚Äôs a beautiful thing to see.‚Äùüì£ The Indian Express is now on Telegram.

But this time, cybercriminals are sending alerts to aspirants regarding ‚Äúimportant notification released due to Novel Coronavirus‚Äù with a link.

Following is the notice issued by the IIT Madras:Wooe is not alone in running fake test-series or online coaching programs with prices too real to be true. Somehow, they get a hold of mobile numbers of government job aspirants and send them messages promoting their fake services. Unfortunately, lots of users fall for it and lose money.* If it‚Äôs too good to be true, it‚Äôs probably a scam. There is no way, a private organisation will provide Rs 40,000 worth of test series for Rs 699, that too with free Netflix subscription for a year.* If the message or website in question has grammar mistakes, it is probably fake that has been built in haste for the sole purpose of scamming people.* Look at the URL carefully. Most of these make-shift websites register a domain that gives it an impression of association with a reputed institute‚Äî in this case, IIT Madras. Check for the association. If IIT Madras would have been providing test series, you can find it with a simple Google Search. Also, if you just search IIT Madras, you will get to know that the institute‚Äôs URL is iitm.ac.in and not iitmadras.online.* Don‚Äôt trust random educational portals.

https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/mobile-tabs/before-razr-motorola-was-testing-tablet-style-foldable-phone-design-6332576/,"Before Razr, Motorola was testing tablet-style foldable phone design",2020-03-26 15:11:01+05:30,"Motorola‚Äôs original foldable device was a tablet-style phone, before it finalised the design of the new Razr. However, the company felt such a device was too large and thus veered in favour of a more compact, flip-style form factor.‚ÄúWe tested multiple prototypes. We tested a tablet-style too, but we wanted to have an ultra-compact design,‚Äù Prashanth Mani, Country Head, Lenovo Mobile Business Group and MD, Motorola Mobility, India, told indianexpress.com in a telephonic interview.The new Razr is a reboot of the iconic Razr flip phone from 2004. The revamped version, however, is a modern Android smartphone with a screen that measures 6.2-inch diagonal but folds in half. When fully closed, the device easily slips into a pocket.Motorola was first to launch the Razr foldable phone with a clamshell design late last year and soon Samsung followed with the Galaxy Z Flip. The Galaxy Z Flip too has a flip phone-style form factor but features a foldable glass screen and is cheaper than the Razr.Without getting into comparisons, Mani said both foldable phones have pros and cons. ‚ÄúI think both devices have their own uniqueness in this category,‚Äù he said.Like in the case of the Razr, the phone has a secondary 2.7-inch OLED screen on the outside of the clamshell for notifications when the phone is closed. The Galaxy Z Flip, in contrast, has a tiny 1.1-inch pill-shaped external display that is limited in functionality. The Razr is impressively thin and the hinge that allows the phone to lay completely flat. But where the Galaxy Z Flip scores over the Razr is on the display front and internal hardware. The Galaxy Z Flip is also cheaper in comparison to the Razr.‚ÄúThe design defined Razr for us. In every decision point, the look and feel of the device were kept in mind. So we have succeeded in our view in creating a device that embodies our code philosophy, simplicity, surprise, and richness,‚Äù he explains. Mani said it took the company four years to design the Razr and the team worked closely with Lenovo‚Äôs laptop team to perfect the hinge.Neither the Razr nor the Galaxy Z Flip is perfect, but many critics have found that the Razr is less powerful in terms of specifications. Some even had a harsh opinion on the average camera performance.Mani has defended the company‚Äôs decision to go with the Snapdragon 710 processor and a single 16MP camera on the Razr that costs Rs 124,999. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not just about megapixel or megabytes. It‚Äôs also about what the design bodies, what kind of craftsmanship goes into it, and what kind of material is used. We believe that these are things that make a phone premium today,‚Äù he says. He said that as the price band goes up, the most important thing people consider in a phone is the design language and craftsmanship.Whether a consumer chooses the Razr or the Galaxy Z Flip, both phones have fascinating new technology that‚Äôs largely untested on a large scale, and these phones are expensive to manufacture. Despite the high price of the Razr, Mani believes there is a set of customers who would want to spend the money on a foldable phone. ‚ÄúThe market is big enough for foldable phones,‚Äù he said confidently.¬†The new Razr‚Äôs Rs 124,999 price includes 18 per cent GST, which has increased the cost of the device in India. Fluctuation in the exchange rate and local duties have further added to the retail price of the Razr. The phone has been made in China and not in India, where Motorola manufactures its other smartphones.Mani agrees that the foldable devices are in the early stages and it will take some time to see the growth in the category. ‚ÄúThe foldable itself is at a very nascent phase but we think the category will grow significantly over the next one or two years,‚Äù he said, adding that the company will continue to invest in the foldable tech and work with our partners to develop further functionalities on it.‚ÄùOne big feature the Razr lacks is the 5G connectivity. Although 5G networks are not going to be live in India this year, if you are going to spend Rs 124,999 on a phone, you might expect the feature to be there in the device. However, Mani said the company‚Äôs priority was to get the foldable phone right and 5G was not something Motorola aimed to add in the Razr.Motorola hasn‚Äôt announced a 5G smartphone yet, but the company is looking at this space closely. In fact, both foldables and 5G are important areas for Motorola in the coming years.Mani was tightlipped on the company‚Äôs next foldable phone, but he did say that the team is evaluating multiple designs and form factors. Virtually every smartphone maker is working on foldable smartphones and trying to perfect the technology.The new Razr, which was intended to go on sale from April 2 in India, could be delayed further due to the three-week pan-India lockdown. The country has been put under complete lockdown for 21 days in an aim to curtail the spread of coronavirus in the nation of 1.3 billion people. Flipkart, the exclusive online partner to sell the Razr, has temporarily suspended operations in view of the 21-day lockdown. The phone was also supposed to be available from the top 200 offline stores in India.üì£ The Indian Express is now on Telegram.

Plus India is in a 21-day lockdown. One easy and simple way to best some of this stress is to play video games. Studies show that video games also help us improve our response timings and cognitive thinking. Here we will be recommending a few games for you to play during all this free time, with no bar on the gaming product you own.Give most of are now dependent on our mobiles, let us first list out games you can play on the smartphone itself to keep the mind occupied. You can also check out our earlier list on the best games you can play while in self-quarantine.PUBG MobilePUBG Mobile is one of the most popular games across the globe on both iOS and Android. It is also a very easy game to get a hold off. I recommend that you start playing this game, as it has a different mode for every kind of player, like Team Deathmatch, Battle Royale and more. It will also give you the chance to chat with your friends while they play from their homes.Ludo StarIf you want to reminisce about your childhood, when your friends used to come over and all of you would play Ludo, you can download Ludo Star. This game allows you to play Ludo with your friends wherever they are and chat with them via voice or text. You can also play the game with your family members or roommates. You can also connect with random people and make new friends.Asphalt 9: LegendsAsphalt 9: Legends is a pure racing game, that will be able to give you most of the thrill that a real race car would be able to. Asphalt 9: Legends is the best the series has to offer as of now in terms of graphics and controls. Another feature is that they also have a licence from a lot of car companies to use their car names and designs. Thus, providing you with the extra bit of realism.Subscription service (PlayStation 4, Xbox One)My first option would be to get the PlayStation Plus or Xbox Gold service as it will provide you with a number of free games that you can play during this quarantine. It is more fun as you do not know which games will come up the following month, hence helping you grow as a gamer, by pushing you to play different genres of games.The Last of Us (PlayStation 4)Read the name of the game. Yes, that is what it is. Sure coronavirus is not turning people into hideous monsters, but it is no joke.¬† This game will help provide you with a vent as you try and stay alive in a post-apocalyptic Earth where you‚Äôre likely to be killed by other humans. This game might make people anxious about the future, so we recommend that you play this with caution.Resident Evil 7: Biohazard (PlayStation 4, Xbox One, PC)Resident Evil is a series that comes to any gamers mind, when you say the word zombie. And why would it not, it is one of the best zombie games there is, with the right amount of thrill, horror and storyline.Why I chose this version to recommend you is because in this you are trapped in a home, with the Baker family that is very bad at social distancing and is confirmed to be infected. It‚Äôs one of the best horror genre games that I have played to date. A bonus point would be if you would happen to have a PS VR, to play it on. The horror just intensifies.Tom Clancy‚Äôs The Division 2 (PlayStation 4, Xbox One, PC)This game can be is the most relatable in the current scenario. Your character is a part of an elite squad must re-establish peace in a lawless America, set in the aftermath of a viral (weaponised smallpox). To some, it might feel borderline offensive. So play at your own risk.FIFA 2020 (PlayStation 4, Xbox One, PC)To get out of the dark and gritty, you can play the new FIFA 2020, which has been developed by Volta and EA in collaboration. This collaboration provides us with two games at once, FIFA Street and FIFA. This helps the gamers change to a different version of FIFA when bored. It is quite an interesting and fun game that helps you have the fun of watching football even when there are no football matches taking place.NFS Heat (PlayStation 4, Xbox One, PC)If racing games is your genre then NFS Heat is the game that you need to play. It brings back the memories that you might have made while playing the original NFS Most Wanted. It is basically Most Wanted on steroids with better graphics and controls. However, not all is good and the fact that you need to shift between day and night and complete some missions in between just make the game a tad bit boring.Assassin‚Äôs Creed Odyssey (PlayStation 4, Xbox One, PC)Assassin‚Äôs Creed Odyssey is a very long game (40+ hours), so you won‚Äôt be running out of the storyline anytime soon. And it basically lets you do what any other Assassin‚Äôs Creed game allows you to do, and that is jumping, exploring and assassinating. It a fun game, and even though I have not completed it, it intrigued me enough to recommend it to everybody.The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the WildThis is a game that tells the story as to what happened when Link is trying to repair the damage that happened during a 100-year-old war that Link and Princess Zelda lost against Ganon. There is a lot of exploration that is needed to be done and it has an interesting story line that can provide you with a fun time during this lockdown.Pokemon Sword and Pokemon ShieldPokemon games that are available for Nintendo consoles are extremely engaging and fun. The last Pokemon game I played was Pokemon Black and from what I have seen in the trailers, it is a must have game. With it you get to travel the fictional Pokemon world, capturing various different Pokemons and then battling it out to be the best.Super Mario Maker 2Mario has been one of the most popular video game characters owned by Nintendo ever since its first game was launched. The character since then has been featured in multiple game series. Super Mario Maker 2 lets gamers create their own custom courses using assets from various games across the Super Mario franchise and then play them themselves or share them online for others to play. It reminds users of the older days, when they used to play Super Marios Bros on an 8-bit gaming console.üì£ The Indian Express is now on Telegram.

We have already discussed how fraudsters are posing as WHO officials to carry out phishing attacks, tricking people to click on malicious links or download harmful content, registering new malicious websites related to COVID-19, putting up fake coronavirus apps¬†and setting up fake COVID-19 tracking dashboards to hack computers.Now there is a new scam doing the rounds. A new report by Sophos ‚Äî a British security software and hardware company ‚Äî shows that cybercriminals are using extortion emails claiming they will infect a user‚Äôs family with coronavirus if the user does not pay the ransom money.Sextortion is well-known among people where cybercriminals send ‚Äúdirty little secret‚Äô emails saying they‚Äôve got hold of the user‚Äôs compromising pictures via malware and they‚Äôll leak it to the whole world, including their friends and family‚Äî unless the user decides to pay them a hefty amount of ransom money.In the new trend, criminals have tweaked the extortion to match up with the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. Cybercriminals are sending emails asking for $4000 via Bitcoins or else they‚Äôll not only reveal secrets, but will infect every member of the victim‚Äôs family with coronavirus.To sound authentic and get the person‚Äôs attention, the sender first reveals the password that was previously used by the victim. They claim they know all the passwords and that they have been keeping a close watch on the user, and could even infect their family with coronavirus. The email also includes a threat to reveal all of the user‚Äôs secrets. Check out the whole email in the screenshot attached below:There‚Äôs a chance they could have extracted your password from publicly available data leaked in an old data breach. So even if the whole this is a scam, what do to now? Paul Ducklin, the Principal Research Scientist at Sophos, explains that there is no need to be scared. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt send any money.

https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/after-scrapping-mobile-world-congress-organiser-gsma-offers-refunds-6331442/,"After scrapping Mobile World Congress, organiser GSMA offers refunds",2020-03-25 19:11:15+05:30,"The organiser of the world‚Äôs biggest mobile technology conference, MWC 2020 in Barcelona, will offer refunds or discounts to future gatherings to the tens of thousands of attendees and companies that had paid to attend February‚Äôs canceled event.
MWC was an early major casualty of the coronavirus pandemic, and it had never been scrapped in its 33-year history. By removing it from the calendar, telecom heavyweights lost a significant opportunity to generate marketing buzz around their latest wares. The industry‚Äôs biggest players often spend tens of millions of dollars to exhibit at the show, and smaller ones pay in the hundreds of thousands.On Wednesday the GSMA, the trade body for the mobile technology industry, said in a statement it will offer full refunds to all attendees for the cost of their tickets, which cost 799 euros ($865) for a basic admissions pass. For large exhibitors, the GSMA wants to incentivize discounts on attending the show in future years as an alternative to claiming large refunds.Mats Granryd, the director general of the GSMA, said in an interview with Bloomberg at the time MWC was canceled that the trade body was ‚Äúlooking for solidarity‚Äù and everybody bearing their own costs.It looks like that may be happening, to some extent. Some large operators have already expressed to the GSMA their intention to participate in MWC next year, according to a person with direct knowledge of the situation. These include Orange SA, Telefonica SA, Vodafone Group Plc and NTT Docomo.Larger companies will get the option of receiving a credit worth 125% of what they paid to exhibit at this year‚Äôs show, which will be applied as a 65% discount on the cost of attending next year, plus 35% and 25% discounts on the two subsequent years respectively.Alternatively, they can claim refunds equivalent to 50% of their spend for MWC 2020, up to a maximum of 150,000 pounds ($178,000).For smaller exhibitors ‚Äî those who spent up to 5,000 pounds ‚Äî a full refund will be offered. However, these firms can also opt to waive a refund and instead be granted a 125% credit and three years of discounts.Companies that had canceled their attendance prior to the GSMA calling of the show will be offered credits and discounts, but not cash refunds. The GSMA‚Äôs board is made up of executives from a number of the world‚Äôs biggest operators, including Vodafone and Deutsche Telekom AG, who agreed to the initial cancellation. The GSMA isn‚Äôt expecting its operator members to seek refunds.About 80% of the GSMA‚Äôs annual budget is derived from the money it generates from MWC Barcelona, according to two people familiar with the group‚Äôs budget.But internally, executives don‚Äôt consider the cancellation of MWC 2020 and Wednesday‚Äôs offer of refunds to be an existential threat, according to an executive with direct knowledge of board-level conversations who didn‚Äôt want to be named discussing private matters.üì£ The Indian Express is now on Telegram.

https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-reviews/mi-dual-driver-in-ear-earphones-review-balanced-audio-at-a-budget-6331406/,Mi Dual Driver In-ear Earphones review: Balanced audio at a budget?,2020-03-26 12:48:10+05:30,"The Indian consumer puts a lot of emphasis on bass when it comes to audio preferences that‚Äôs why a lot of manufacturers focus primarily on lows in their speakers and headphones. However, it has led to the neglect of mids and highs in earphones‚Äî at least in the budget segment leaving you no with no choice, but to shell out more money to go for a premium offering for balanced audio.That‚Äôs the problem Xiaomi claims to have solved with its Mi Dual Driver In-ear Earphones, but is this affordable product able to deliver what it claims? The product is priced competitively at Rs 799 and here‚Äôs what I think about the product after a month of usage.Right from the get-go, the Mi Dual Driver In-ear Earphones remind of the Realme Buds 2. It has a braided cable, the earpiece sets have magnetic ends, the mic is affixed on the right cord with volume rockers and play/pause buttons.Although Realme‚Äôs offering looked more premium than Xiaomi‚Äôs product, there are few things that I liked in the Mi Dual Driver In-ear Earphones. These are light-weight earbuds; I could use the earphones straight for three-hours without feeling the urge to take them out. The plastic cover over the magnetic end that saves the paint from scratches. Also, there is kevlar-style design underneath the plastic and it looks quite good.The anodized aluminium earbuds have a matte finish that is fingerprint-resistant and looks good too‚Äîespecially the blue-coloured variant. The earbuds tips are angular in shape and ensure a better fit. You also get additional tips in the box with different sizes so you can switch them with the right size.The overall design looks sturdy and the braided cable prevents the wires from tangling. I kept the earphones in my pockets and laptop bag and never had to struggle to untangle it. The Mi Dual Driver In-ear Earphones come with an L-shaped connector that is definitely more practical.The right cable in the Y-splitter carries the microphone and remote which falls within the reach. The buttons are tactile and the mic works just fine. Also since the mic hangs at the right height, you do not need to adjust it while receiving or making a call.Coming to the sound quality, Mi Dual Driver In-ear Earphones come with Dual Driver ‚Äî one 10mm and another 8mm Dynamic Driver. Xiaomi says that one driver handles the low frequencies while the other takes care of mids and highs. However, in practical usage, I did not feel much of a difference.The Mi Dual Driver In-ear Earphones are mostly bass-heavy and you can feel the strong lows while listening to bass-centric tracks. People who like strong bass will definitely like this.Express Tech is now on Telegram. Click here to join our channel (@expresstechnology) and stay updated with the latest tech newsI was really hoping that Xiaomi‚Äôs claims regarding the efficient handling of mids and highs come true, but looks like there is much work to do. The highs are acceptable, but mids are not that clear as the bass boost spills over here. You can feel the effect even when you listen to podcasts.Overall, the Mi Dual Driver In-ear Earphones do not offer a balanced audio experience but are perfect as a daily driver and for bass-heavy soundtracks. For those who want budget earphones under Rs 1,000 can definitely consider Mi Dual Driver In-ear Earphones for its light-weight design and bass-heavy performance.üì£ The Indian Express is now on Telegram.

https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/cold-flu-or-covid-19-this-ai-tool-can-help-you-differentiate-6331334/,"Cold, flu or Covid-19? This AI tool can help you differentiate",2020-03-26 21:16:52+05:30,"The coronavirus is confusing for the common man, since its similar to any common flu. And this creates confusion about who can, or should, get tested. To tackle this problem, Sydney-based Medius Health has created Quro, a risk assessment tool to determine whether you should be tested for Covid-19 or not. The AI digital health startup run by Indian Abhi Bhatia has so far done more than 75,000 consultations since rolling out the tool on March 4 in India and Australia.‚ÄúWhen Covid-19 hit, we had enough understanding of how we can utilise our medical knowledge graph at the backend and developed an AI-powered risk assessment tool which presents the users with questions related to symptoms and risk factors in accordance with the World Health Organisation protocols and guidelines,‚Äù the founder of Medius Health told indianexpress.com over phone from Sydney.Quro, an AI-based risk assessment tool, is like an anonymous consultation where people do not need to sign up or give personal details. The tool, which acts as a virtual health guide, asks a number of questions such as your travel history, past medical history, your symptoms, what sort of problems you are having right now from a symptomatic point of view and so on. The tool is free to use and can be accessed on the web.But collecting the data is one part of the story, says Bhatia. His team, which consists of data scientists and clinical scientists, has created an artificial intelligence (AI) system called disease frequency and evoking strength that extracts the data and using different combinations, it understands the relation between symptoms and disease. And based on that, its AI system predicts whether a person is at higher risk for getting sick from Covid-19 or not.The system gets updated frequently, based on the data and the trend provided by the World Health Organisation (WHO) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). ‚ÄúWe keep on updating the prevalence rate value of those relationships between coronavirus and a particular symptom. So for instance, when coronavirus started picking up, the doctors realised that nasal congestion is the one thing that actually differentiates between a flu as well as coronavirus, but then a lot of things have changed,‚Äù he said.Bhatia said the aim was to ‚Äúquell the panic‚Äù and at the same time offer ‚Äúthe right set of information‚Äù so that people should know that this could be a mere cold and flu and not Covid-19. He further added that the tool will help identify those people who have a high risk of Coronavirus and need to get the testing done.The tool [Quro] will help people understand how to differentiate between symptoms that are more relevant to coronavirus versus influenza. That is the biggest problem right now because everyone who‚Äôs coughing and has some sort of nasal congestion, they feel that it‚Äôs a coronavirus and it‚Äôs creating a lot of panic among people,‚Äù he explains.Citing the example of India, Bhatia said the risk assessment tool could be useful for a country with a population of 1 billion, where unnecessary fear among people about Covid-19 can put a lot of burden on hospitals and healthcare institutions.According to Bhatia, 69.2 per cent of people from India who have accessed the risk indicator have lower chances of contracting Covid-19, 22.7 per cent of profiles fall in the moderate risk category and just 9.1 per cent of people are at a higher risk of complications from the deadly virus.Bhatia feels that the tool can help government agencies and health organisations in understanding the magnitude of Covid 19 and take necessary steps before it gets too late to stop it from spreading.The company has reached out to the Ministry of Health to push out the risk assessment tool to a large population base in India. Meanwhile, Medius Health is working with a couple of partners in India to deploy the tool, including ICICI Prudential and Bajaj Financial Services. The company is also developing a special platform for Max Healthcare.It took Bhatia and his team 8-9 days to develop the tool. ‚ÄúBefore we roll out any AI tool, we train the model and then we have to do internal testing. In this case, we created different kinds of case simulations that we picked up from Wuhan. For instance, who was traveling, where these people were traveling, what was the age group, what was the gender, what geographical patterns that they have, what was the onset of symptoms? So we picked up that data from WHO and created AI-driven case simulations that we then injected into our platform,‚Äù he said.At a time when the developed countries like the US and Italy are failing to stop the coronavirus outbreak, Bhatia acknowledged that the use of Artificial intelligence (AI) can be a game-changer in healthcare.‚ÄúAI comes into play as early detection, collecting the data on a mass scale so that we can create epidemiological population-level information through which the government can allocate the resources at the right place, and put people in the right bucket. So if there‚Äôs a high-risk person, he should be the one who should be isolated first and get proper testing done,‚Äù Bhatia said.He further that those data points will further help train models and the AI engine would even be able to predict within those high-risk people who are least touched to coronavirus and who are more prone to infectious disease.Medius Health, which was founded in 2017, has a team of 32 people including data scientists, doctors and software engineers. The startup has so far raised AUD 4.2 million in two rounds and is looking to close its Series A from a consortium of investors from India and Singapore.üì£ The Indian Express is now on Telegram.

https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/coronavirus-internet-speeds-slow-netflix-hotstar-amazon-prime-youtube-reduce-streaming-quality-6331237/,"Coronavirus impact: As internet speeds fall, streaming services forced to dial down quality",2020-03-26 11:02:43+05:30,"The coronavirus pandemic is breaking the internet, in every sense of the word. Trends observed by Ookla, known for its SpeedTest app and website, show that across the world fixed broadband and mobile broadband networks are seeing a decline in their speeds, ranging from 10 per cent to 20 per cent in some cases. The reason: more and more people are now in lockdown, working from home, and with children staying back as well, there is increased burden on networks.One major factor for this is video, according to Doug Suttles, Co-founder and General Manager at Ookla. ‚ÄúOver half of the internet uses video. Anything else is small in comparison. The issue is that everyone‚Äôs working from home and suddenly kids don‚Äôt have school and they are home too. There‚Äôs a whole lot more video consumption. It‚Äôs gotten a lot larger,‚Äù Suttles explains, adding that ISPs cannot add capacity overnight to their networks.To give some context, JustWatch, an international streaming guide, has seen a 60 per cent spike in traffic from India and 81 per cent from US. So world over streaming services are now working to reduce the load. In India too, most major streaming players have followed suit and announced measures.YouTube, for which India is the biggest market in terms of consumers, confirmed Tuesday it was reducing its default video quality to standard definition across the world. In India, YouTube streaming will be at 480p on mobile networks by default until April 14, which is when the official lockdown declared by the government is supposed to end.‚ÄúWe continue to work closely with governments and network operators around the globe to do our part to minimise stress on the system during this unprecedented situation. Last week, we announced that we were temporarily defaulting all videos on YouTube to standard definition in the EU. Given the global nature of this crisis, we will expand that change globally starting today,‚Äù a Google spokesperson says on this change.Read our guide on how to ensure that streaming websites don‚Äôt consume all your data¬†Other players in India like Sony, Facebook, Amazon Prime Video, Viacom18, Zee, Hotstar, TikTok and MX Player have also agreed to stream at SD or standard definition content, in order to ensure there is no strain on the networks, which will consume less data.In a collective decision, the companies have announced they will temporarily be defaulting HD and ultra-HD streaming to SD content or offering only SD content at bitrates no higher than 480p on cellular networks. The measures will stay in effect till April 14.Meanwhile, Netflix has decided to reduce load on the telecommunications networks in India by 25 per cent, while maintaining the quality of service for the next 30 days. ‚ÄúGiven the crisis, we‚Äôve developed a way to reduce Netflix‚Äôs traffic on telecommunications networks by 25% while also maintaining the quality of our service. So consumers should continue to get the quality that comes with their plan ‚Äì whether it‚Äôs Ultra-High, High or Standard Definition,‚Äù says Ken Florance, VP Content Delivery, Netflix in a statement.Work from Home appears to be the norm for many of us. We at Indian Express tech have some articles which could help make this easier. First, how to optimise your WiFi, which is really important. Read on that here. Next, we explain how to save data on WhatsApp given we might be using a lot more of this. Then we explain how you can balance screen time while doing work from home. Also these video calling apps can be useful when relying on work from home. Don‚Äôt let it be all about work, you can rely on these fitness apps to continue that workout during the lockdown. And finally some general tips to keep in mind while working from home. So if a customer wants to continue streaming at a higher resolution, and their plan allows the option, the content will be available at that UHD or HD or SD resolution, except the streaming will be at a lower bitrate. The company has removed the highest bandwidth streams in order to reduce load on the networks.While on-demand video streaming platforms are working to reduce the load on networks, there‚Äôs no doubt that the increased demand has impacted speeds in India already. The good news is that Ookla‚Äôs numbers showed that while fixed or wired broadband has declined at some level in India, it is not so sharp.But mobile broadband has seen a steeper decline of about 10 per cent across networks. The data shows that in India there is also a 5 per cent decline in upload speeds for mobile and fixed broadband as well.‚ÄúThe trends are similar in India to what we are seeing over the world. Week-over-week, there‚Äôs a clear uptick in testing. People are concerned with their network, having issues and wanting to solve those problems. In India, we are seeing about a 10 per cent decline in performance for mobile broadband networks, though the fixed broadband networks have not seen such a sharp decline,‚Äù Suttles says.The decline in mobile networks is not surprising if one looks at the numbers put out by the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) on the number of subscribers for mobile vs fixed broadband. Wired broadband connections stood at 19.13 million subscribers as seen on December 31, 2019. In contrast, the number of mobile broadband subscribers stands at 642 million. For many mobile is the primary and only form of internet connectivity and in these congested times, the networks will face an increased burden.More around coronavirus impact on the tech worldSamsung, Oppo, vivo shut down factories in India | Coronavirus outbreak is impacting Indian smartphone market | From Kerala, a robot to take care of coronavirus patientsIn countries where work from home has been mandated, and is being followed, there is a 10 to 20 per cent reduction in performance. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs different in some countries is that it has affected mobile broadband more. India is an example of that. In the United States, it has impacted fixed broadband but mobile speeds have stayed the same,‚Äù explains Suttles.Another trend that Ookla has observed is that there is a general uptick in the number of people running speed tests to check on internet quality. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs interesting because usually it happens more often in the evening for fixed broadband when people come home from work. People are testing throughout the day and night now. More mobile tests used to happen typically during the day, but now we are seeing all kinds of tests throughout the day,‚Äù he adds.It is not just video streaming services that are working to optimise their services. Content Delivery Networks (CDN‚Äôs) such as Akamai are also working to reduce traffic congestion.Akamai announced it will work with leading distributors of software, particularly for the gaming industry, including Microsoft and Sony, to help manage congestion during peak usage periods. Gaming software downloads account for large amounts of internet traffic and it will be crucial to manage this, especially as more people are staying home.Express Tech is now on Telegram. Click here to join our channel (@expresstechie) and stay updated with the latest tech news‚ÄúAkamai‚Äôs intelligent edge network architecture is inherently designed to mitigate and minimise network congestion, and because we have deployed our infrastructure deep into carrier networks, we can help those networks avoid overload by diverting traffic away from areas experiencing high levels of congestion,‚Äù a statement quotes Dr Tom Leighton, the CEO and Co-Founder of Akamai.In regions where demand is creating bottlenecks for customers, Akamai will be reducing gaming software downloads at peak times, and completing the downloads at the normal fast speeds late at night. The approach, it says, will ensure that while gamers can still get their downloads, health workers will not face any issues with the digital services that are vital.Another consequence of the lockdowns is more usage of VPN or Virtual Private Networks, which can help users access websites or content which might not be allowed in their country. According to ExpressVPN, it has seen an increase of 21 per cent in the average global usage of its service since the end of February. In India, there‚Äôs been a growth of 15 per cent in VPN usage.‚ÄúWe are seeing strong demand in our services as more people spend more time indoors and employees around the world telework,‚Äù says a statement from Harold Li, vice president, ExpressVPN.But how long will the strain on the networks continue? The Ookla co-founder gives the example of China and how the situation played out there, where the coronavirus outbreak began and was followed by a lockdown in Wuhan.‚ÄúSix weeks ago, China looked like the other parts of the world do now, where everyone shifted to working from home. There were a lot of slowdowns on the internet. It took five to six weeks for things to return to normal there. But as of the last two weeks, it looks like it used to before,‚Äù he points out.In his view, if the lockdowns and social distancing measures are adhered to, and everyone does stay home, it would take a month or so for internet speeds to get back to normal, though he cautions, it will depend on the number of people actually staying at home.üì£ The Indian Express is now on Telegram.

https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/gaming/apples-app-store-rules-limit-rival-gaming-services-while-arcade-runs-free-6331291/,Apple‚Äôs App Store rules limit rival gaming services while Arcade runs free,2020-03-25 17:40:04+05:30,"Video-game fans suddenly have their pick of a huge menu of titles thanks to a raft of new mobile subscription services from Apple Inc, Microsoft Corp, Alphabet Inc‚Äôs Google and Nvidia Corp. But for the more than 1 billion users of Apple‚Äôs iPhone and iPad, the only real option is Arcade, the subscription service launched by the company in September.That‚Äôs because Apple imposes strict limits on the kinds of apps users can access on its devices. For example, App Store guidelines ban services that rely on streaming from the cloud. Arcade adheres to the requirements, in part, because it‚Äôs included as a feature within the App Store itself. This is the latest example of what critics say are arbitrary rules favoring Apple‚Äôs own apps at the expense of similar software from outside developers.‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a fraught relationship between developers and Apple precisely because of rules like this,‚Äù said David Barnard, a longtime independent developer and advocate at RevenueCat. ‚ÄúIn some ways, I am incredibly grateful to their marketplace for helping me make millions of dollars I wouldn‚Äôt have made without it. On the flip side, them being so heavy handed at times does kill apps and does cause developers to miss out on other potential revenue.‚ÄùIf software developers want to reach as many consumers as possible, they have to be on Apple‚Äôs iOS. The operating system powers more than 1 billion smartphones and tablets and it‚Äôs the only way to access the iOS App Store, which accounted for 65 per cent of app spending globally last year, according to Sensor Tower. The Cupertino, California-based company can also make or break mobile gaming businesses: More than half of the $62 billion spent on smartphone gaming last year happened on Apple products.Cloud gaming services, where users stream games live over the internet, are growing in popularity, especially as faster fifth-generation, or 5G, wireless networks proliferate. The new offerings from Microsoft, Nvidia and Google are cloud streaming-based, while Apple Arcade is not. Those other services are found on the Android operating system, which powers 2.5 billion devices worldwide. Among the popular games found there, and missing from iOS, are Red Dead Redemption 2, Gears of War 5 and Destiny 2.Asked about the challenge of reaching iPhone and iPad users with the chipmaker‚Äôs GeForce Now service, an Nvidia spokesperson said: ‚ÄúAsk Apple.‚ÄùApple said its ‚Äúcustomers enjoy great apps and games from millions of developers and gaming services can absolutely launch on the App Store‚Äù if they follow the App Review Guidelines, which means that games have to be submitted individually, allowing them to appear in App Store rankings and search. The company also said it intends to continue building on its relationships with developers and providing a level playing field.‚ÄúDevelopers can choose to reach all iPhone and iPad users over the web through Safari and other browsers on the App Store,‚Äù Apple said. But currently the new cloud-based gaming streaming services aren‚Äôt accessible through web browsers on iPhones and iPads.Whether the restrictions raise antitrust issues is another matter. The policies were in place before the latest gaming services launched, and ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt see it cutting one way or the other,‚Äù said David Reichenberg, an antitrust lawyer at Cozen O‚ÄôConnor.Apple said there is strong competition in every category in which it makes its own apps. Arcade, only available on iOS, is $4.99 per month for more than 100 games and is a growing contributor to the company‚Äôs services revenue, which is important amid a period of reduced hardware sales growth.At least one gaming subscription offering, GameClub, has managed to get on the App Store. It licensed several old-school games, released them all on the App Store as separate apps under one developer account and offers one $4.99 subscription that works across the apps. Still, it was rejected 127 times by Apple before being approved. ‚ÄúThe amount of effort we put into making sure the app played by Apple‚Äôs rules was no joke, it was a huge undertaking,‚Äù Eli Hodapp, GameClub‚Äôs head of business development, said.In February, Microsoft released a beta version of its gaming service, currently dubbed xCloud. It is still in free preview, but is expected to launch later this year as a paid service under the company‚Äôs Game Pass brand. A look at the software shows the contortions that it and other Arcade rivals will have to pull off to get on Apple‚Äôs system. While Microsoft‚Äôs has a catalog of 90 games available on Android, just one, Halo, appears on the iPhone test version. Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft and Mountain View, California-based Google declined to comment.The Android variant of xCloud lets users choose from multiple games built by different publishers. A version of the app on iOS could only have games either developed or exclusively licensed by Microsoft.Apple outlines this in an App Store rule that says ‚Äúgames offered in a game subscription must be owned or exclusively licensed by the developer.‚Äù For example, Microsoft‚Äôs iOS service can offer Halo because Microsoft produces that game, but not Ace Combat from Bandai Namco.This restriction prevents game developers from being able to work with game partners already on other platforms. Apple said Arcade complies with all the guidelines. Microsoft makes several of its own games, but Google and Nvidia would only be able to launch if they exclusively licensed third-party titles. Google‚Äôs Stadia costs $9.99 per month and new games are added monthly. Nvidia offers free and $4.99 per month subscription tiers, but requires a user to login to a Valve Steam account to access many titles.A related guideline bans the subscription services from carrying over upgrades like levels, extra weapons and characters unless they are also available as an in-app purchase in the App Store. Like many other apps, this gives Apple a 30 per cent cut of revenue from developers, while confusing users who play video games on multiple platforms. It also means more overhead for developers.If a developer is able to build or license enough games for a service, they would still be prohibited from releasing an all-you-can-eat gaming subscription service on iOS that works inside of a single app.Many games are available to be downloaded individually from their creators, but consumers increasingly like to subscribe to a bundle of games at a lower monthly price ‚Äî much like they‚Äôd subscribe to Apple Music instead of downloading individual songs or sign up for Netflix instead of buying specific movies.The same rule that bars non-exclusive titles requires that ‚Äúeach game must be downloaded directly from the App Store.‚Äù This means an app can‚Äôt include a catalog of games and must be broken up into separate apps. Apple said the guideline is to prevent games from being added or removed without review. Apple allows catalog apps for magazines, newspapers, music, videos and books.‚ÄúThe App Store was created to be a safe and trusted place for customers to discover and download apps, and a great business opportunity for all developers,‚Äù Apple said. ‚ÄúBefore they go on our store, all apps are reviewed against the same set of guidelines that are intended to protect customers and provide a fair and level playing field to developers.‚ÄùWhile a game developer could feasibly workaround the first few games-related guidelines, Apple‚Äôs decision to block games that stream directly from the cloud is an iOS deal-killer for Microsoft‚Äôs xCloud, Google‚Äôs Stadia and Nvidia‚Äôs GeForce NOW.Apple‚Äôs rules state that ‚Äúthin clients for cloud-based apps are not appropriate for the App Store.‚Äù This type of app does little on the device, with most of the action offloaded to remote data centers, much like how Netflix streams movies. In contrast, each Apple Arcade game runs fully on the device without the need to stream data from the cloud.Cloud streaming works on an early test version of Microsoft‚Äôs app, but if a full app like that was submitted to the Apple App Store it would probably be rejected. Microsoft‚Äôs beta app is available currently to 10,000 users through an Apple testing service called TestFlight, which traditionally follows the same rules as the App Store.Apple says that developers that publish games on the App Store benefit from features like Siri, backups and App Store promotion. Having to build a service without cloud streaming would be a lot more work for traditional game developers and would mean they have to re-create their apps for each platform rather than leverage their existing game libraries.Apple lets devlopers use a technology called remote desktop. This is similar to cloud streaming, but instead of piping in content from a data center, the game is streamed from a Mac, Windows computer, or gaming console. This method comes with a major caveat: users can only stream from a computer or console that they own and the iPhone must be on the same network as the first device. That means you can stream a game in your living room, but not on the bus to work.That has allowed apps like Sony‚Äôs PS4 Remote Play and Valve Steam Link. Microsoft xCloud for Android has a similar option for streaming from an Xbox, but the feature is missing from the iPhone. It‚Äôs unclear why Microsoft didn‚Äôt include it.Major technology companies aren‚Äôt the only ones having trouble getting on the App Store. For months, one app from Shadow, a Paris-based cloud gaming developer, appeared to survive Apple‚Äôs rules. That changed at the end of February when Shadow‚Äôs platform was removed. Shadow relied on streaming games from PCs in a server farm, versus computers owned by users. Shadow said it‚Äôs talking to Apple about getting back on the App Store.

https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/social/facebook-is-just-trying-to-keep-the-lights-on-as-traffic-soars-in-pandemic-6331205/,Facebook is ‚Äòjust trying to keep the lights on‚Äô as traffic soars in pandemic,2020-03-25 20:32:57+05:30,"As the coronavirus spread around the world and people everywhere were ordered to stay home, phone calls over Facebook‚Äôs apps more than doubled. In many countries, messaging on Instagram and Facebook soared by more than 50%, while group calls in Italy jumped by more than 1,000%. And hungry for information, people clicked repeatedly on virus news stories shown by the social network.Inside Facebook, that meant the pressure was on.‚ÄúWe‚Äôre just trying to keep the lights on over here,‚Äù Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook‚Äôs chief executive, said in an interview last week.As airlines, hotels, restaurants and other companies struggle to stay afloat during the pandemic, Facebook is also laboring to cope with the fallout. But unlike those other businesses, the Silicon Valley giant is being strained by the coronavirus in a different way: Its usage is going through the roof.Skyrocketing traffic and a crush of new users are now stressing Facebook‚Äôs systems just as its 45,000 employees are dealing with working remotely for the first time. The company is also trying to keep its users‚Äô data secure while employees who sift through posts to moderate content do so from home. At the same time, Facebook has added to its workload by promising to do more to limit virus misinformation.It is a pressure test moment for Facebook, which has for years grappled with a backlash over privacy and toxic content, but now has a chance to change that narrative and be seen as an essential communications and information tool during the outbreak.‚ÄúThe usage growth from COVID-19 is unprecedented across the industry, and we are experiencing new records in usage almost every day,‚Äù Alex Schultz and Jay Parikh, two Facebook vice presidents working on infrastructure, said in a blog post on Tuesday. ‚ÄúMaintaining stability throughout these spikes in usage is more challenging than usual now that most of our employees are working from home.‚ÄùWhat has saved Facebook‚Äôs network from crashing altogether, Zuckerberg said, was that the virus and the quarantines have had the largest impact in just a few areas where Facebook operates. Facebook is banned in China, where the virus first appeared, for instance.Those areas that have the highest concentration of people using Facebook‚Äôs services during peak hours from home are also spread out by time zone, Zuckerberg said, which staggers the swell of traffic.‚ÄúIt really is a big technical challenge,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre basically trying to ready everything we can.‚Äù He said Facebook had mobilized its engineers to make sure the company has enough computing capacity and adequate support to handle the surges.The strain has been compounded by Facebook‚Äôs workforce adapting to working from home, which had been discouraged in the past.The company‚Äôs executives have long preached internally that face-to-face meetings and in-person collaboration were central to Facebook‚Äôs success. The importance of in-person conversation was so great that employees at offices from Singapore to New York were frequently asked to travel to the company‚Äôs headquarters in Menlo Park, California, for quarterly meetings.That has made the transition to working from home especially difficult, said four Facebook employees who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly.To communicate, Facebook employees were told to use BlueJeans, which provides technology for videoconferencing calls, they said. But they quickly found that calls were frozen, or the video quality so bad that it was hard to make out who was speaking. Many employees instead turned to Apple‚Äôs FaceTime feature, Google video hangouts or Zoom conference calls. Some even built their own version of a video conference call, according to two employees.Issues quickly piled up.Two days into working from home, some Facebook managers sent the engineering teams a message: limit idle chat on work message boards.Facebook employees had been posting on those boards at a record rate, according to one employee. While some workers were sharing tips and best practices of how to set up a home office, others were sharing links to buy heirloom seeds for at-home farming, and instructions on how to sew their own face masks, one employee said.Other snafus surfaced.Last week, a bug within Facebook‚Äôs system began marking thousands of posts by major news outlets like Politico and The Sydney Morning Herald as spam, which resulted in the removal of the posts. It took Facebook a day to correct the mistake, as engineers struggled to communicate remotely with one another over how the bug had been introduced and what it would take to fix it.While they scrambled, rumors spread among Facebook‚Äôs users over the source of the bug, with many accusing the company of censoring people‚Äôs speech. Internally, Facebook managers said that while the bug was routine, the amount of time it took to fix it was not.‚ÄúThis was just a technical error, and we‚Äôre still doing the post-mortem to understand what happened so we can operationalize any learnings from that,‚Äù Zuckerberg said last week.Working from home has also made moderating Facebook‚Äôs posts more difficult. This month, Facebook put its army of global contractors from outside agencies on paid leave. Those contractors, who number more than 15,000, are responsible for sorting through the posts, images and videos that flow through Facebook‚Äôs services on a daily basis to weed out sensitive, explicit or hateful material.As the outbreak spread, contractors were ordered not to come into the office, where they worked on protected networks behind virtual firewalls to maintain user privacy. Many of those contractors do not have the same technology setup at home.Facebook is still trying to figure out how to let the contractors continue working. For now, it is relying on full-time employees, who do not have the training or the time, to moderate the posts themselves.Given that, Facebook employees have been asked to remove only the most sensitive, fringe posts, said one employee. The company also told employees that it would rely more heavily on their artificial intelligence systems to flag and remove posts.‚ÄúI do think it‚Äôs reasonable to expect that for some of the other categories where the severity might not be as imminent or extreme, that we may be a little less effective in the near term while we‚Äôre adjusting to this,‚Äù Zuckerberg said.While Facebook‚Äôs usage is soaring, that may not translate into financial gains. Most of the increase in traffic has occurred on the company‚Äôs messaging services ‚Äî like WhatsApp and Messenger ‚Äî which bring in relatively little revenue. And though more people are using the main News Feed and Facebook Stories in the core app, the company said it wasn‚Äôt immune to a wider pullback in advertising.‚ÄúOur business is being adversely affected like so many others around the world,‚Äù Schultz and Parikh said in the blog post. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve seen a weakening in our ads business in countries taking aggressive actions to reduce the spread of COVID-19.‚ÄùZuckerberg said Facebook was doing what it could to prepare for the weeks ahead, as it doesn‚Äôt anticipate the issues to abate anytime soon.‚ÄúI‚Äôve never seen anything like this before,‚Äù he said.üì£ The Indian Express is now on Telegram.

According to a new study, these naturally occurring superconducting materials were found embedded inside two distinct meteorites that crash-landed on Earth.Superconductors are important for humans as the material can conduct electrical current without resistance. The material ensures ‚Äòperfect‚Äô conductivity and finds use in a lot of areas. Even though the superconductor inside the Australian meteorite is a known material, its discovery in space debris comes as a shock.Meteorites have been known to deliver minerals to Earth that we have never seen before as well as materials that are older than our Solar System itself. However, this is the first time meteorites crash-landed on Earth with embedded superconductive grains.Also Read | Earth‚Äôs mini-moon left the planet‚Äôs orbit, but there will be more to comeResearchers from UC San Diego investigated fragments from 15 different meteorites using magnetic field modulated microwave spectroscopy to detect traces of superconductivity inside samples.

The other one is a rare¬†ureilite¬†meteorite¬†GRA 95205 which was located in Antarctica a quarter-century ago.The study is published in the PNAS or Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America. According to the research, measurements and analysis identified alloys of lead, indium, and tin in the meteorite sample which were not previously found in space debris.‚ÄúEven the simplest superconducting mineral, lead, is only rarely found naturally in its native form, and, to our knowledge, there are no previous reports of natural lead samples superconducting,‚Äù the authors¬†explain in their paper.Express Tech is now on¬†Telegram.

https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/opinion-technology/realme-blog-narzo-10-10a-launch-amid-coronavirus-pandemic-india-lockdown-6330648/,"The Realme Blog: The Narzo series is coming, but is this a good time? [Updated]",2020-03-25 11:08:20+05:30,"Recently Realme posted a video on its social media channels and everyone thought the company is releasing a music video or something. But no, it was the promo video of a new smartphone series called Narzo. Wait, what? Narzo? What does that even mean? Well, Realme is yet to reveal the mystery behind the name, but it does say that this series is for Generation Z aka the youth.It‚Äôs great that the company is trying different strategies to attract consumers but I feel it is a bad time to launch a smartphone in India given companies are being affected by the closure of manufacturing units and workers unable to come to work.The Narzo smartphone series was said to launch in India on March 26 but it has now been delayed due to 21-day pan India lockdown. Realme is yet to confirm the new launch date.It was supposed to be a recorded launch video as most employees are working from home. However, all this was before Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced a 21-day pan-India lockdown. Most companies have postponed their scheduled launch events to April.Here‚Äôs everything we know about Realme Narzo smartphone seriesRealme has also suspended its manufacturing operations in Greater Noida, Uttar Pradesh from March 21, 2020 due to coronavirus pandemic. The brand also said that COVID-19 will temporarily affect the inventory and supply in the market for some time. This could not just impact the sales of the Narzo series but also all other recently launched Realme phones.With Realme Narzo the company wants to be more than just a camera phone, given that has been its key focus for (almost) all its recently launched phones. It has revealed that both the Narzo 10 and Narzo 10 A will come with a powerful processor, impressive screen, big 5000mAh battery paired with fast charging support. Teasers have confirmed that the Narzo 10 will include four cameras at the back while there 10A will sport three of them.I feel the Realme Narzo series will take a different approach as far as the design is concerned. The teasers show that the Narzo 10 with quad cameras will sport Realme X special garlic and ginger edition like design with vertical lines throughout the rear panel of the phone. I had used the Realme X ginger edition for some time when it was launched last year and feel it‚Äôs still the best-designed Realme phone so far.What is Narzo? What does it mean?The Narzo 10A on the other hand sports a similar design as the Realme power bank with a huge vertically placed logo throughout the back cover. It looks different and unique from other phones from the company.It is still unclear why Realme is bringing a separate smartphone series in India given the market is already flooded with Realme number series, C series U series, Pro series, X series, and X Pro series phones.Note: After this blog was posted Realme informed us that the Narzo series launch has been delayed due to India lockdown. The new launch date hasn‚Äôt been revealed as yet.¬†Work from Home appears to be the norm for many of us. We at Indian Express tech have some articles which could help make this easier.

https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/techook/xiaomi-redmi-k30-pro-vs-poco-x2-6329450/,Redmi K30 Pro vs Poco X2: Which one is better?,2020-03-25 10:19:57+05:30,"Redmi K30 Pro is now official in China, and is the successor to last year‚Äôs Redmi K20 Pro. The K series under the Redmi brand offers flagship-like specifications, but at a more reasonable price, and this is a trend that has continued with the K30 phones as well. So it is not surprising the Redmi K30 Pro runs the Qualcomm Snapdragon 865 processor, which is the high-end variant for this year.While the Redmi K20 series was launched in India, the K30 series has not yet made an appearance, unless you count the Poco X2. That‚Äôs because the Poco X2 is essentially the re-branded version of the Redmi K30 in the Indian market, and it is quite an affordable phone for what it offers.There‚Äôs no word on whether Redmi K30 Pro will come to India and whether it will have a different name. But the new Redmi phone does raise some interest given what it offers. There‚Äôs also the question of how does the new Redmi K30 Pro phone compare to the previous phone.¬† Given the Poco X2 has the same specifications as the Redmi K30, we are comparing it to the new Redmi K30 Pro. Here‚Äôs a look at the specifications, features of the two phones.Redmi K30 Pro has been launched at Yuan 2,999 (approximately Rs 32,260) for the 6GB RAM/64GB storage variant, at Yuan 3,399 (approximately Rs 36,560) for the 8GB RAM/128GB storage variant and at Yuan 3,699 (approximately Rs 39,770) for the 8GB RAM/256GB storage variant.Express Tech is now on Telegram. Click here to join our channel (@expresstechie) and stay updated with the latest tech newsThe Poco X2 is comparatively much cheaper at Rs 15,999 for the 6GB RAM/64GB storage, Rs 16,999 for the 6GB RAM/128GB storage variant and Rs 19,999 for the 8GB RAM/256GB storage variant.The Redmi K30 Pro is being offered in Moonlight White, Sky Blue, Purple and Space Grey colour options. And the Poco X2 comes in Atlantis Blue, Matrix Purple and Phoenix Red colour options.Both the Poco X2 and the Redmi K30 Pro sport a glass back panel held together by a metal frame. Poco X2 comes with a p2i Splash-Proof coating, which makes it water repellant, however, the Redmi K30 Pro comes with a proper IP53 dust and water resistance rating.Also Read:¬†Poco X2, Redmi K20, Realme X2: These are best phones under Rs 20,000 right nowRedmi K30 Pro comes with an in-display fingerprint scanner, while the Poco X2 features a side-mounted one just like the Samsung Galaxy S10e.¬† Both the devices sport a circular looking camera module trying to mimic the Huawei Mate 30 Pro‚Äôs back camera. But based on the visuals, the Redmi K30 Pro‚Äôs camera looks better.One major differentiator between the two phones is that the Poco X2 has a pill-shaped cut-out to accommodate the front cameras, while the Redmi K30 Pro sports a motorised pop-up selfie camera. One advantage is that pop-up selfie camera does not hinder any content that you are viewing and ensures the true edge-to-edge display experience.Poco X2 does not have a proper pill-shaped cut-out, rather it has two separate holes joined by pixels that have been turned off using the software. This causes the Poco X2 to have a shadow effect near the cut-out.Also Read:¬†Realme 6 Pro vs Poco X2: Which mid-range should you buy?Redmi K30 Pro sports a 6.67-inch Super AMOLED display with HDR10+ support and has a 92.7 screen-to-body ratio. It comes with a 60Hz refresh rate panel according to various reports, however, Xiaomi is yet to comment on that. The device has a 180Hz touch sampling rate, which would make the display capable of at least 90Hz. However, Xiaomi could be holding this back due to software issues and might enable it at a later point with the help of an update.Poco X2 also comes with a 6.67-inch display. However, it uses IPS LCD technology instead of AMOLED technology. Where the Poco X2 pulls ahead is that it comes with a 120Hz refresh rate display. This would make the viewing experience better on the Poco X2, due to the smoothness of the display. It also enhances the gaming performance as there is minimal screen tearing while playing high frame rate games.Also Read:¬†What is Realme Narzo? Is it Realme‚Äôs answer to Redmi, Poco?Redmi K30 Pro comes with Qualcomm‚Äôs flagship Snapdragon 865 processor and comes with what Xiaomi calls as the ‚Äòlargest vapour chamber liquid cooling system.‚Äô¬† ¬†The Poco X2, on the other hand,¬† uses the Qualcomm Snapdragon 730G processor. The processor is good and can handle heavy gaming quite well, making it a good phone. But given the Redmi K30 Pro‚Äôs flagship processor, it will obviously show better results.The Redmi K30 Pro comes with a quad camera setup on the back, which consists of a 64MP Sony IMX686 primary sensor paired with a 13MP ultra-wide-angle lens, an 8MP telephoto lens and a 5MP depth sensor. The camera supports taking images in HEIF and RAW formats, They also support 8K video recording. On the front, it sports a 20MP motorised pop-up selfie camera, just like its predecessor the Redmi K20 Pro.Poco X2 also comes with a 64MP quad-camera setup on the back. This consists of a 64MP primary sensor, an 8MP ultra-wide-angle sensor, a 2MP depth sensor and a 2MP macro sensor. On the front, it has a dual camera setup consisting of a 20MP primary sensor paired with a 2MP depth sensor.Also Read:¬†Confused between Realme 6 and Redmi Note 9 Pro?

The coronavirus outbreak and subsequent lockdown means more people are working from home. Add to that schools are also closed and with children at home the end result is that a lot more data is being consumed whether for work or for entertainment purposes.Especially for those with children at home, streaming apps or services like YouTube, Hotstar, Netflix, Amazon Prime Video can all act like solid data guzzlers. Already Netflix, Amazon Prime Video have announced they will be reducing streaming quality in Europe, America.But there are settings in each of these apps to ensure that you can optimise your data consumption. We explain how to keep a track for some of the popular streaming services.The good thing about Netflix is that they give out comprehensive details on how much data is consumed based on the settings.¬†According to the help page, watching shows or movies on the streaming service will see the consumption of around 1GB of data per hour at standard definition or 720p. For HD video, this jumps up to 3GB of data per hour. The page also notes that ‚Äúdownloading and streaming consume a similar amount of data.‚ÄùSo how can you reduce some data usage on Netflix? Well, the service has four options for data usage. There‚Äôs low which consumes 0.3 GB per hour per device, followed by medium or SD, which comes to 0.7 GB per hour per device and high which consumes around 3GB per hour. The highest is the Ultra HD or 4K which consumes 7 GB per hour per device.Must read: From Kerala, a robot to take care of coronavirus patientsKeep in mind that the data usage settings only apply to the one Netflix profile.

Follow these steps to optimise your data consumption on the Netflix website.Log into Netflix.comSelect the profile for which would like to change your data usage settings for and select AccountUnder My Profile, select Playback SettingsSelect your desired data usage setting, though the default is usually at auto.

Higher will use more storage when you download content.¬† Netflix says users will not be able to change this setting if they have any pending downloads. Cancel them, and then try again or wait for them to finish.With automatic settings for mobile data usage, Netflix does around 4 hours of streaming per GB of data. The save data setting, brings down consumption per GB to around six hours of streaming on Netflix. The maximum data setting streams at the highest possible level and uses nearly one GB per 20 minutes or more. It would be best to change it if this is the level right now on your devices.Amazon Prime Video also lists out the amount of data used when streaming at different quality options. The service uses around 0.38GB data per hour with a good quality setting, for better it rises to 1.48GB per hour. The best quality setting consumes nearly 6.84 GB per hour.

https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/coronavirus-outbreak-testing-the-whatsapp-chatbots-by-who-and-indian-government-6329630/,Coronavirus pandemic: We checked out the WhatsApp chatbots by WHO and Indian government,2020-03-25 15:52:28+05:30,"While the government is trying to contain the spread of the coronavirus pandemic, fake news peddlers are busy spreading misinformation regarding the COVID-19 disease. WhatsApp has partnered with the World Health Organisation and the Indian government to launch two chatbots in order to provide authentic information about the coronavirus.The MyGov Corona Help Desk chatbot for the Indian WhatsApp user has been developed by Jio Haptik Technologies Limited and powered by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare together with the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology.The chatbot developed by WHO provides global information regarding the COViD-19 outbreak and is simply known as the ‚ÄúWorld Health Organization‚Äù.The MyGov Corona Helpdesk can be accessed by adding +91-9013-151515 to your contacts and sending a message or by following this link: wa.me/919013151515. The WHO chatbot can be accessed by adding +41-7989-31892 to your contacts and sending a message or by following this link: bit.ly/who-covid19-whatsapp. I tried both of these chatbots and here is what I found:The MyGov chatbot introduces itself as ‚Äúthe Government of India‚Äôs Coronavirus (COVID-19) Helpdesk to create awareness and help you and your family stay safe‚Äù and straight up shares the emergency helpline number and email address for the Indian users.The chatbot has six options in total:1. Latest Update on Coronavirus in India
2. What is Coronavirus and what are its symptoms?
3. How does Coronavirus spread?
4. How to reduce the risk of Coronavirus?
5. Professional advice by AIIMS-Director
6. Where to get help?Users need to reply with the number written against a query to make the selection.When I pressed 1, the chatbot informed me about the confirmed cases of coronavirus in the country along with active cases, cured or discharged cases, and the number of deaths by COVID-19. However, the information with chatbot does not refresh too often. Even at 3:45 pm in the evening, it continued to show stats from 10:30 am in the morning.In the same message, the MyGov Corona Helpdesk shared the number of testing facilities in the country, along with a link to a document containing state and district wise details of COVID-19 cases. It also had links to the MyGov website and MOHFW website.The response from the chatbot also carried the latest announcement made by the government related to the coronavirus outbreak. In the morning, it shared the lockdown announcement and around 3 pm, it shared information about the Prime Minister‚Äôs address to the nation scheduled at 8 pm.For other responses, the chatbot presented useful information regarding symptoms, spread of disease, and health tips with the help of YouTube videos, graphical pamphlets, and more. It also shared links to videos by Director, AIIMS-Delhi to learn and clear doubts on coronavirus. This can be particularly useful given so many fake videos of ‚Äòdoctors‚Äô are being shared on WhatsApp.If you press 6, the chatbot shares helpline numbers again with an option to view state-wise helpline numbers.The MyGov chatbot and WHO chatbot are not that different, but the latter is aimed at a much wider audience. It presents users with eight options and users need to send the number written before a query to get the information.The WHO chatbot gives you ‚Äúlatest numbers‚Äù of coronavirus patients from around the world as well as new cases reported in the last 24 hours. You can also check country numbers by tapping on the link shared by the chatbot. The chatbot also lists out COVID-19 symptoms together with advisories to ‚Äúprotect yourself‚Äù.It also shares ‚Äúmyth-busters‚Äù as well as ‚Äútravel advice‚Äù. I would urge readers to see these myth-busters in particular, and share them on WhatsApp considering this is authenticated information.With WHO chatbot, users can get the latest news updates shared by the WHO with just a tap. My favourite part of this chatbot was the third option‚Äî ‚ÄúYour questions answered‚Äù. Once you complete all the question-answers, you will feel like an expert on the subject leaving no doubt for any confusion. These reponses cover all aspects of the coronavirus (SARS-Cov-2) and the COVID-19 disease.Express Tech is now on Telegram.

A few weeks ago Jio, Vodafone and Airtel added a dedicated caller tune on all numbers to spread COVID-19 awareness message among the citizens of India. The caller tune mentions the symptoms of coronavirus and preventive measures one can take.With COVID-19 cases significantly rising in India Jio has now added a ‚Äúsymptoms checker‚Äù option on its MyJio application. The symptoms checker is available on the app starting today. We tried to use the checker on an iPhone first but it wasn‚Äôt available as yet.

https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/from-kerala-a-robot-to-take-care-of-coronavirus-patients-6329400/,"From Kerala, a robot to take care of coronavirus patients",2020-03-25 06:48:07+05:30,"As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to spread in India and across the world, Kochi-based startup Asimov Robotics has developed a robot that can be deployed in hospitals to ease pressure on the medical staff. The three-wheeled robot can carry food, medical and clinical consumables and navigate freely in the hospitals. The robot has been developed in 15 days by a team of seven people.‚ÄúIt is impractical to deploy human-like robots in hospitals. This is why we are working on a cost-effective model which is very practical at this point,‚Äù Jayakrishnan T, CEO of Asimov Robotics told indianexpress.com on phone.Jayakrishnan said the robot is mainly designed to be used inside isolation wards. The robot, dubbed ‚ÄúKARMI-BOT‚Äù, has lower and upper trays that can be loaded with food or sterile containers. Additionally, the robot also disinfects the used items as it comes out of the quarantine zone. The robot also lets doctors or relatives interact with the patients through video calling.Jayakrishnan said the robot has autonomous navigation and can be used remotely as well. The advantage of deploying a robot in this scenario is to cut down on human to human contact. This will help both health workers and visitors.Express Tech is now on Telegram. Click here to join our channel (@expresstechnology) and stay updated with the latest tech newsThe robot is currently being tested internally and fine-tuned at the lab. ‚ÄúIf spares are ready, we can make one robot per day with the current facility itself,‚Äù he said.Jayakrishnan said the interest in the robot is increasing, even though the product has not been out yet. The company has been talking to clients in the US and the Middle East. However, Jayakrishnan is aware that to meet the demand, the firm needs to set up a production line and expand the facility which may take some lead time. For now, though the company wants to focus on the domestic market and its home state.Jayakrishnan declined to reveal how much it costs to make the KARMI-BOT, but said it will be cheaper to produce than the existing robots. ‚Äú US clients are specifically interested in non-Chinese products, which is an advantage for us. Our ultimate aim is to load it with features and bring the cost below Chinese competitors,‚Äù he said.Asimov Robotics, which is incubated within the Kerala Startup Mission, is one of the few high-tech robotics companies from India that focuses on healthcare.‚ÄúOur robots are connected and not standalone products. The robots are connected to the distributed sensor network and use AI and MI to come to a decision and based on that decision, they respond,‚Äù he explains.In China, many hospitals have deployed high-tech robots to deliver food to patients, take patients‚Äô temperatures, deliver medication and disinfect the facility. Similarly, the Spanish government is planning to test 80,000 patients a day using robots in a bid to fight the pandemic.Earlier this month, Jayakrishnan and his team deployed two humanoid robots at the entrance of Maker Village at the Kinfra Hi-Tech Park in Kalamassery to create awareness about the coronavirus outbreak and distribute masks and sanitisers to people who work in the Integrated Startup Complex.Jayakrishnan is also working on a realistic humanoid robot similar to Sophia. The robot, called Chhaya, is able to converse, understand and synthesise expressions.üì£ The Indian Express is now on Telegram.

According to the instructions, he should have gotten a text message with a unique pin for activation of the tracking app once home.But Wong, who hasn‚Äôt left his home, only received a text message after 24 hours had passed. When he tried to activate the app by scanning the QR code and inputting the pin, he got an error message.Wong tried calling the Office of the Government Chief Information Officer, which created the system, but the line was either busy or the person who answered couldn‚Äôt provide assistance. Wong‚Äôs friend who flew back with him encountered the same problem.The Office of the Government Chief Information Officer said in an emailed statement that a small number of people had been unable to receive text messages because of incomplete or incorrect phone numbers on quarantine-order forms. Hong Kong‚Äôs Department of Health plans to follow up on any cases of activation failure, according to the statement.Wong‚Äôs wristband is one of around 24,000 tracker bracelets the government has distributed to monitor new arrivals. The band is meant to connect to an app that sends out alerts asking the person to take pictures of themselves wearing the wristband, and issues warnings if it senses the person had left their place of residence. The device detects and analyzes radio signals, including Bluetooth and wifi, as well as geographical location signals when it‚Äôs activated.Mandatory self-isolation is one of the policies being taken in Hong Kong to curb the spread of Covid-19. The city‚Äôs Chief Executive Carrie Lam on Monday announced the government will also ban all foreign travellers from entering the city for 14 days and prevent bars from serving alcohol.Charmaine Man, a 24-year-old working in film production, is another person affected by the wristband issue. She hasn‚Äôt received any text message since returning to Hong Kong from Malaysia on Saturday. Even though she plans to stay at home for the entire isolation period, she‚Äôs worried about any potential legal risk due to the system‚Äôs failure.‚ÄúThis is a mandatory quarantine, but when I can‚Äôt activate the app, will they consider I‚Äôm breaking the law?‚ÄùScores of people in Facebook groups have also reported the same problem, while there have been photos and videos of people taking their quarantine wristbands on public transport.üì£ The Indian Express is now on Telegram.

However, it turned out to be a brief affair of events as the mini-moon left the planet‚Äôs orbit.2020 CD3 was first discovered on February 15 using the NASA-funded Catalina Sky Survey observatory in Arizona. According to the astronomers, the object may have entered Earth‚Äôs orbit three years ago. Bill Gray, an astronomy-software developer, told the Atlantic that the 2020 CD3 likely left our orbit on March 7.

https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/cognovi-panic-index-shows-how-sentiment-on-jobs-spiked-after-coronavirus-was-declared-pandemic-6329321/,Cognovi Panic Index shows how sentiment on jobs spiked after coronavirus was declared pandemic,2020-03-25 17:35:25+05:30,"How does a pandemic impact human sentiments? The Panic Index created by Cognovi Labs, a US-based AI and predictive behavioral analytics company, has shown that in US people‚Äôs fears around employment shot up from 24 to 64 as soon as coronavirus was declared a pandemic and the United States restricted travel from Europe.The Cognovi ‚ÄúPanic Index‚Äù measures people‚Äôs emotional response towards Covid-19 in realtime and it‚Äôs impact on stock markets, dining, shopping, travel and other economic activities. The Dayton, Ohio startup takes advantage of Twitris, a Wright State University-developed machine learning tool, to take a sample of social media happenings about Covid 19 and use a combination of human, machine learning and understanding of behavioral psychology to interpret the conversation and then extract sentiments about what they are searching for in real-time.‚ÄúThis [technology] extracts emotions from free-flowing conversations‚Ä¶maybe any social media chatter if people are posting on blogs or forums or Twitter and it extracts the emotions from that ideally short-form text. It‚Äôs probably the best tool and has the highest capability of extracting emotions of any tool in the world that we‚Äôve seen,‚Äù Colin Butler, Global Revenue Officer, Cognovi Labs, told Indianexpress.com in a telephonic interview.The tool fetches a mix of emotional and non-emotional words based on searches related to the event. For example, in India, Cognovi Labs is relying on the data available on Twitter. These searches can be different from country to country and state to state. As the data updates in real-time, the Cognovi Panic Index shows a different picture of that event, based on people‚Äôs emotional sentiments.Express Tech is now on Telegram. Click here to join our channel (@expresstechnology) and stay updated with the latest tech news‚ÄúThe baseline of the technology is that extracts the emotion and once you have the emotions, we use a proprietary appraisal theory to understand how those emotions combine to predict future action,‚Äù he continues.The decision to create the Cognovi ‚ÄúPanic Index‚Äù was taken a few days ago. ‚ÄúThe index, we created, measures the public‚Äôs emotional state over the coronavirus. Through a dashboard, we can see how the emotionality heats up in different geographical areas. And since people make decisions based on emotions, as the fear heats up, you really understand what the population‚Äôs predilection is towards a certain behavior or maybe how they actually feel about a certain topic,‚Äù he explains.Butler believes that the vast majority of decisions that humans make are based on the subconscious mind and not the logical mind. ‚ÄúIf you are able to extract emotions somehow, you get a predictive window into behavior of people,‚Äù he said. Cognovi Labs has in the past successfully predicted the Brexit referendum hours before the polls closed as well as the results of the 2016 U.S. presidential elections.The core to the machine learning tool, which Cognovi Labs uses to extract emotions from social media chatter and quantifies human behavior to predict the outcome of events, was developed by co-founder Dr Amit Sheth at the Kno.e.sis Center at Wright State University.Cognovi Labs‚Äô AI technology, which took eight years to develop, was funded by the US Air Force, the National Science Foundation, and the Department of Energy. According to Butler, Cognovi Labs has a perpetual and exclusive license to use the technology.Investors of Cognovi Labs include Harvard Business School Alumni Angels of Greater New York, the Ikove Start-up Nursery Fund out of Columbus, and Bossa Nova Capital in Brazil, among others.Butler, who was previously head of business development at a hedge fund and an investment banker with over 20 years experience on Wall Street, says Cognovi Labs‚Äô Emotion AI technology can help governments, corporations, advertisers, marketers and retailers to tweak their future strategies based on people‚Äôs emotions at the time of a pandemic like Covid-19 or any political event.üì£ The Indian Express is now on Telegram.

https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/mobile-tabs/iphone-12-pro-max-what-is-sensor-shift-stabilization-and-how-does-it-work-6329041/,iPhone 12 Pro Max: What is sensor-shift image stabilization and how does it work?,2020-03-26 17:10:32+05:30,"Most high-end camera smartphones, including the iPhone 11 Pro Max, come with OIS or Optical Image Stabilization. The tech has been used in smartphones for quite some time.¬†However, Apple‚Äôs upcoming iPhone 12 Pro Max, might be the first smartphone to feature the new sensor-shift stabilization instead of lens-based optical image stabilization.
Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo believes the iPhone 12 Pro Max would benefit from the brand new sensor-shift image stabilization technology when it launches later this year. But what is Sensor-shift image stabilization and what‚Äôs makes it superior to OIS? Let‚Äôs find out.Image stabilization is a common term used in photography. Simply put, Image stabilization (or IS) enables photographers to take blur-free images or videos without a tripod. Any camera with a built-in image stabilization allows you to shoot at slower shutter speeds than one without, delivering a noise-free and sharper image. There are different kinds of Image Stabilization but we stick to sensor-shift image stabilization and optical image stabilization.The Sensor-shift image stabilisation system or IBIS (In-Body Image Stabilization) incorporates a floating sensor that helps counterbalance any movement within the camera. If your camera has IBIS, all of the lenses will also have image stabilization. In-Body Image Stabilization has become popular among the high-end mirrorless camera. A lot of Sony, Fuji and Olympus cameras feature In-body image stabilization. IBIS currently works with interchangeable lens cameras and has yet to launch on smartphones.Express Tech is now on Telegram. Click here to join our channel (@expresstechnology) and stay updated with the latest tech newsAs opposed to inside the camera, OIS uses the phone‚Äôs gyroscope and tiny motors to shift the camera‚Äôs lens or sensor. What‚Äôs interesting with OIS is that the image is stabilized before it reaches the sensor, so there is no loss of quality in image quality. This allows the autofocus to function more accurately. Nokia Lumia 920 was the first smartphone to feature OIS.The difference in image quality isn‚Äôt drastic, but the good thing about SSIS is that it can be combined with any lens. That means if Apple manages to bring SSIS to the iPhone 12 Pro Max, all the three lenses would be stabilized. The iPhone 11 Pro‚Äôs ultra-wide-angle lens, for instance, is not stabilized.

The Redmi Note 9 Pro series was launched last week in India, and while the Redmi Note 9 Pro has already gone on sale, the Redmi Note 9 Pro Max, which has a 64MP camera at the back was supposed to go on sale on March 25.The company relies on third-party contract manufacturers, but given there is lockdown in most districts in India, it is likely that operations will be impacted. However, the more affordable Redmi Note 9 Pro is going on sale today on Amazon India and Mi.com.Xiaomi India head Manu Kumar Jain tweeted that the Redmi Note 9 Pro Max sale has been postponed, though he did not confirm an exact date for when the phone will go on sale. The company has also announced that it plans to donate N95 masks to help fight against the COVID-19 outbreak.Both the Redmi Note 9 Pro and Redmi Note 9 Pro Max are powered by the Snapdragon 720G processor and support NaVIC, which is India‚Äôs own navigation satellite system. However, the Redmi Note 9 Pro Max gets a higher 64MP camera, comes with 33W fast charging and also has a 32MP front camera. The Redmi Note 9 Pro has a 48MP camera, 18W fast charging and a 16MP front camera.Wondering if you should get the Redmi Note 9 Pro instead? Read our full reviewThe Redmi Note 9 Pro starts at Rs 12,999, while the Redmi Note 9 Pro Max starts at Rs 14,999 going up to Rs 18,999 with the highest version offering 8GB RAM and 128GB storage.As noted yesterday, Realme confirmed that it was also shutting down production in the Greater Noida region. The brand is also getting ready to launch its upcoming smartphones, Realme Narzo 10 and 10A, which are supposed to be part of a new series. While the launch event is taking place on March 26, Realme says the livestream has been pre-recorded.It also said that the actual sale dates which might be mentioned during the online event could change, given this was recorded before a lockdown was ordered. There‚Äôs no confirmation on when these Realme phones will go on sale for now.Vivo has also confirmed that it is delaying the launch of its new V19 smartphone, which was due to launch in India on March 26. In a statement on Twitter, the company said, ‚Äúthe well being of our customers, partners, employees and fellow citizens is our number one priority.

The V19 is supposed to come with six cameras, a quad-camera set up on the back, and two front cameras.Xiaomi has also cancelled the launch of its 108MP camera phone Mi 10 in India. The device was supposed to launch in the country on March 31, 2020, but it has been postponed. ‚ÄúWe, at Xiaomi India are focusing our energy and synergy to support the nation in its fight against the #COVID19 pandemic.

The tech firms have not disclosed any financial impact from the outbreak so far.‚ÄúThis is not going to be business as usual, and the marketing industry is certainly going to see a real impact. I don‚Äôt think anyone knows how big. So we‚Äôre going to watch and look,‚Äù Facebook Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg told Bloomberg TV last week.There are positive signs for the internet giants, though.Hyundai, Toyota and GM were among automakers who started to run online ads last week directly or indirectly mentioning how they were adjusting practices because of the coronavirus, according to commercials seen by Reuters.The warning from Twitter comes two weeks after it reached an agreement with Elliott Management that allowed Jack Dorsey to stay on as chief executive and added three new directors.As part of the agreement, Twitter had pledged to grow daily users by 20% or more in 2020 and beyond, roughly in line with user growth in its fourth quarter.Twitter said on Monday total monetizable daily active users (mDAU) jumped 23% to 164 million quarter-to-date, driven by the conversation around COVID-19, as well as ongoing product improvements.‚ÄúWe‚Äôre seeing a meaningful increase in people using Twitter,‚Äù Dorsey said.The company said it expects first-quarter revenue to be down slightly on a year-over-year basis. It had earlier estimated revenue to be between $825 million and $885 million, an 8.6% rise from a year earlier at the midpoint.The company is scheduled to announce its results on April 30.üì£ The Indian Express is now on Telegram.

At least 75 districts across India were under lockdown to tackle the coronavirus that has infected 415 people and killed seven in the country with health experts warning a big jump could be imminent.Though India‚Äôs Ministry of Consumer Affairs had urged states to allow some e-commerce deliveries to ensure essential supplies, different state notifications created confusion and have marred operations.China‚Äôs Alibaba Group-backed online grocery firm BigBasket said it faced disruptions in many cities as police were not fully aware of certain exemptions announced by state governments for grocery deliveries and had stopped some of BigBasket‚Äôs delivery staff from operating.‚ÄùWe hope things will improve soon,‚Äù said senior BigBasket executive Hari T.N., who urged governments to intervene to allow seamless grocery deliveries in the country.Japan‚Äôs SoftBank-backed grocery firm Grofers warehouses in cities such as Hyderabad, Mumbai, Pune and New Delhi have been ‚Äúforced (into) lockdown‚Äù, said CEO Albinder Dhindsa.Similar delivery or warehouse disruptions hit Amazon, Walmart‚Äôs Flipkart and Softbank-backed e-commerce website Snapdeal across states, industry executives said.The full extent of the disruptions was not immediately clear.Flipkart said there were ‚Äúoperational issues on ground‚Äù and it was working with governments to resolve them while Snapdeal said uniform implementation of the federal advisory would help reduce disruption for buyers.Amazon said it was working with local authorities to ensure goods arrive safely and without disruptions at clients‚Äô homes.

This has also meant that many companies now have to close down manufacturing units in view of the lockdown orders.Samsung, which has its largest factory in Noida, has confirmed it will be suspending manufacturing. It has also implemented work from home for employees. ‚ÄúAt Samsung, health and safety of employees is our highest priority. As a measure to safeguard our employees and their families against Covid-19 and in compliance with directives from the government, we have decided to currently suspend our manufacturing operations and have asked employees at our sales, marketing and R&D offices across India to work from home,‚Äù Partha Ghosh, Head, Corporate Communications, Samsung India said in a statement.Other players like Oppo and vivo have also reportedly suspended their manufacturing operations, though the latter has not issued a formal statement.‚ÄúSafety of our employees is of utmost priority at OPPO. Keeping the recent outbreak of coronavirus in mind, a host of preventive measures have already been undertaken. Operations in our Greater Noida factory have been suspended as per the directive from the government. Additionally, all OPPO India employees have been advised to work from home until further notice. Our travel advisory is already in play and traveling interstate has been postponed for all employees. Currently, all OPPO employees are in good health and we are complying with guidelines of state and central government to control the epidemic and ensure safety of all OPPO staff,‚Äù Oppo said in a statement.We also reached out to Xiaomi on whether its manufacturing would be impacted, and a company spokesperson said that ‚Äúeach facility such as corporate office, warehouse, Service center, Mi Home, Manufacturing plant will abide by the lockdown orders issued by the state and UTs.‚Äù Xiaomi relies on third-party contractor manufacturers for its manufacturing in India.Realme has also suspended its manufacturing operations in Greater Noida since March 21, according to a statement from the company. The company said it was diligently complying with Government directives and advisories and is taking necessary precautions to ensure employee safety and well-being.‚ÄúWhile this will temporarily affect our inventory and supply in the market for some time, the safety of our workforce is of paramount importance to us. The company will resume manufacturing only after government‚Äôs notice while ensuring safety measures of all employees,‚Äù the statement added. The company also said the upcoming online launch of realme Narzo series was pre-recorded, while taking necessary measures to provide all staff and workers with a safe and healthy environment.The closing of manufacturing units will definitely have a negative impact on the Indian smartphone market. ‚ÄúWe are expecting a major slump in consumer demand till June at least and demand is likely to shift towards the second half, especially festive season,‚Äù Tarun Pathak, Associate Director at Counterpoint Research said in a comment to indianexpress.com.

https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/online-dating-in-a-pandemic-coronavirus-keeps-singles-apart-6328173/,Online dating in a pandemic: Coronavirus keeps singles apart,2020-03-23 18:41:20+05:30,"By Olivia Carville and Nate LanxonStephane, a 32-year-old financier in Manhattan, recently updated his Bumble profile to read: ‚ÄúHealthy male with a strong immune system and robust Purell supply.‚Äù He got a quick reply from a New York woman, who fired back a private message: ‚ÄúTell me your secret‚Äîhow did you get a robust Purell supply? I had to fight a woman at the grocery store for a can of tuna.‚Äù While it was good to hear from another human being, Stephane never responded. Because, well, Covid-19.The novel coronavirus that causes the malady has infected more than 200,000 people around the world and ushered in a fraught new era of online dating. Millennials, trapped under indefinite work-from-home policies and banned from bars, are on dating apps‚Äîswiping, texting, flirting‚Äîmore so than before. Active users rose 8% on Bumble during the second week of March in the US, according to App Annie, which tracks downloads. The big question is how long that will last now that courting in the real world is basically verboten.Dating apps typically run on a freemium model, providing basic services without charge in the hopes that customers will pay more for extra features, such as unveiling who has swiped right on you or applying more granular filters to narrow the dating pool. As social distancing guidelines are rolled out across the US and Europe, dating apps are betting more people will sign up and pay extra to find love‚Äîeven if it‚Äôs virtual for the time being.The bullish view on Wall Street is that users will be willing to spend more time and money on dating apps because they‚Äôve got nothing better to do. The bearish take is they‚Äôll stop paying for extra services because the thought of being within breathing distance of a stranger is more scary than sexy.This month, Brent Thill, an analyst with Jeffries, cut his annual revenue growth forecast from 16% to 9% for Match Group Inc., which owns some of the most popular dating apps in the world including Tinder, OkCupid and Hinge. The shares have fallen 30% over the past month, in line with the S&P 500 Index. ‚ÄúThe big challenge right now is, who wants to go on a date with someone they don‚Äôt know,‚Äù Thill says. ‚ÄúIf I was single, I wouldn‚Äôt want to date anyone right now.‚ÄùNo one really knows how to responsibly date in a pandemic. Some apps are advising couples to meet in open spaces and avoid any form of physical contact; others are suggesting a safer, more sanitary solution: phone sex.‚ÄúWe know it can be a drag being cooped up inside, but there are lots of other ways to have fun: sexting or phone/video sex are great ways to get hot without getting sick,‚Äù the dating app #Open, aimed at couples in open relationships, sent in a message to its 50,000 users on Monday. ‚ÄúThis isn‚Äôt a good time to be swapping spit.‚ÄùLast week, New York Mayor Bill de Blasio was asked how daters should respond to the disaster. That question ‚Äúgoes to the heart of the matter,‚Äù de Blasio said, adding that people cannot get to a point of hopelessness right now. ‚ÄúI do think it‚Äôs fine to have a social life, but you‚Äôve got to exercise some smart rules. If you‚Äôre sick, don‚Äôt go on a date. If the date is sick, don‚Äôt go on the date.‚Äù He suggested keeping a little more distance and said it would be wise even to refrain from kissing one another on the cheek. On Sunday, physically dating in the Big Apple became near impossible as officials closed down restaurants, bars and movie theaters as well as urging residents to stick to strict social distancing guidelines.‚ÄúPeople are feeling isolated, particularly those who are single and can‚Äôt go home to their parents and families,‚Äù says Jordana Abraham, co-founder of Ship, a dating app that allows friends to swipe on behalf of its users. ‚ÄúThey are physically isolated, but not socially isolated.‚ÄùShip says group chat messages exploded 60% nationwide in the past week. Group messages first started ramping up in Seattle when social distancing rules were enforced. They skyrocketed in New York shortly after similar rules were put in place‚Äîwith messages more than doubling in frequency in the past seven days alone.OkCupid has also reported surging engagement and messaging among millennials. People are talking more through the app‚Äîand they are talking about coronavirus. OkCupid saw a 188% increase in coronavirus mentions on dating profiles between January and February. People being people, cringeworthy virus pickup lines are starting to proliferate. As in: ‚ÄúAre you the coronavirus? Because you take my breath away.‚Äù And random hookups are fast being replaced with weeks-long virtual courting, complete with cootie paranoia and forced chivalry.You know who‚Äôs really gonna suffer during this social distancing?Dudes on dating appsWelcome back to courtship, Brad. Welcome back to talking to a gal for WEEKS prior to meeting.We‚Äôre pen pals now, my dude.We bout to get Jane Austen up in here.Now, write me a poem.‚Äî Kaitlyn McQuin (@kaitlynmcquin) March 15, 2020The coronavirus itself even has a mock dating profile, which tells users its hometown is Wuhan, China‚Äîthe epicentre of the outbreak‚Äîand that its major turn-offs are face masks and doctors.Match hasn‚Äôt yet revised its forecasts. The Dallas-based company is monitoring the situation ‚Äúbut can‚Äôt comment definitively on what impact we are seeing,‚Äù a company spokesperson says. Its star performer, Tinder, is also mum on member activity. However, the app, synonymous with a ‚Äúhookup culture‚Äù on college campuses, is urging users to be cautious. ‚ÄúWhile we want you to continue to have fun, protecting yourself from the coronavirus is more important,‚Äù Tinder told to its 5.9 million global subscribers, advising that they wash their hands frequently, carry hand sanitizer, avoid touching their faces and maintain social distance in public.Amsterdam-based The Inner Circle was created for working professionals willing to pay a premium to attend exclusive events, such as cocktail-making classes, jazz nights and ski trips, to meet verified matches. Co-founder Michael Krayenhoff says the virus has presented a wholly unromantic dilemma for the business. ‚ÄúWe had to make a decision as a company to cancel all our events and refund everyone,‚Äù he says.As the pandemic worsened, Inner Circle members began turning to phone calls and video chats. During the first week of March, they were exchanging phone numbers and sending messages about ‚ÄúFaceTime‚Äù and ‚ÄúSkype‚Äù about 30% more often than a month earlier. This led the company to actively promote virtual dating ideas like ‚ÄúSelf-Isolate and Chill,‚Äù a play on ‚ÄúNetflix and chill,‚Äù a euphemism for sex. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs about two people putting on the same television program at the same time, then calling to talk about it as they watch,‚Äù Krayenhoff says. ‚ÄúI think that has something very exciting or romantic to it.‚ÄùLGBTQ dating service Grindr published a notice to users on its app advising them to follow World Health Organization best practices. ‚ÄúThe health and safety of our users is a top priority for Grindr,‚Äù a spokesperson says. Bumble, a dating app where women make the first move, has also been trying to educate its members. Last week, it published a blog post written by Stanford University epidemiologist Seema Yasmin about how to date during a pandemic. ‚ÄúYour best bet would be to meet in a public place that isn‚Äôt too busy, like a park, and stay three to six feet apart,‚Äù Yasmin wrote. ‚ÄúIf you turn up to find your date coughing and looking unwell, you can advise them to practice good cough hygiene then politely get out of there.‚Äùüì£ The Indian Express is now on Telegram.

https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/social/likee-330-million-downloads-short-video-app-tiktok-6328117/,Likee reaches 330 million downloads: What does this short video app offer?,2020-03-23 18:16:27+05:30,"The popularity of TikTok, Likee, VMate and other similar apps leave no doubt about the rising popularity of short video apps. The entry of Google in this space with Tangi app and Instagram‚Äôs decision to roll out a similar feature with Instagram Reels only reaffirms the situation. These apps have created sort of a parallel social media space where videos drive the user interest‚Äì a feat once achieved by Vine with its 6.5-sec video loops.While the future of Vine did not turn out to be fortunate, TikTok and others are still going strong. Earlier, we talked about VMate and this time around we are taking a look at Likee‚Äì a short video platform that registered 208 per cent yearly increase to boast of 115 million monthly active users. The platform also garnered 330 million downloads globally in 2019, with India driving more than half of these installs.Likee claims that its user base in India comprises of people from metro cities, as well as from tier 2 and tier 3 cities. I tried the application and here is what I found.Likee, formerly Like Video, is a ‚Äúglobal short video creation platform‚Äù and it looks no different than the other similar platforms‚Äì at least on the first instance. However, I found the interface of the app a bit more simplistic and easier to navigate than its peers, which might not mean much the usual smartphone user but people who aren‚Äôt tech-savvy probably appreciate it.Aside from the infinitely-long video feed, Likee also comes with a Live feature like the BIGO app. This bit is understandable because Likee is owned by Singapore-based BIGO. Just like the BIGO Live, Likee also allows users to send virtual gifts and roses to their favourite creators.I did not witness objectionable content over the live feeds. Also, it feels reassuring to see a parental control feature on Likee that filters content for young users.Likee also comes with a News tab, which looks like a half-baked attempt. All you see here are video clips that don‚Äôt necessarily fall in the news category and the source of these clips are the usual Likee users.I could spot several media outlets on the app that were posting real short video clips for the news of the day. I personally feel that Likee should reach out to more media outlets to fill its News tab‚Äì which, at the moment, looks a bit unrefined.On Likee, there is support for 15 Indian languages, including Tamil, Telugu, Marathi, Gujarati, Urdu and Sanskrit.Talking about the unique features on the app, BIGO Technology‚Äôs Vice President Mike Ong said, ‚ÄúWe also have a unique feature called ‚ÄòSuperme‚Äô, which enables users to create videos using photos in their gallery. It comes with different features and themes such as creative, morph, dramatic, face cut and festival. Another similar significant feature is the ‚ÄòFace Magic Feature‚Äô, which allows users to have fun by morphing a celebrity face in any of their favourite dance/movie scenes with their own face to create engaging videos.‚ÄùExpress Tech is now on¬†Telegram.

This dashboard is becoming an asset for Indian authorities, administrators, health institutions, individual health practitioners and doctors to gauge the extent of the outbreak and work on strategies on a continuous basis to curb the virus,‚Äù Esri said.This Esri dashboard uses GIS (geographic information system) technology to provide real-time coronavirus updates. It shows cases confirmed worldwide which is currently at 343,421, total number of deaths and also the ones that have been recovered. Unlike a lot of other dashboards, this one shows cases confirmed country-wise as well.Currently, the countries with most cases are China, Italy, the US, Spain, Germany, followed by Iran, France, South Korea, Switzerland, the UK and the rest.The Esri dashboard also shows graphical representation on the confirmed and daily increase of cases to provide people with a better idea of what‚Äôs happening around the globe and also in their own country. Esri has collaborated with WHO, CDC, ECDC, NHC, DXY, 1point3acres, Worldometers.info, BNO, state and national government health departments, and local media to update the information on the dashboard.The dashboard also allows everyone to just click the country on the map and get details like confirmed cases, deaths, recovered, and existing cases of the region in just a single click.üì£ The Indian Express is now on Telegram.

https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/social/managing-screen-time-during-work-from-home-apples-screen-time-google-android-digital-well-being-apps-6328020/,These features will help you manage screen time during work from home,2020-03-24 11:01:34+05:30,"The coronavirus pandemic means that many of us are now working from home in India. Most major Indian cities are under lockdown, and work from home has become the norm, but it comes with its own benefits and headaches. While the stress of commuting might have disappeared for sometime, many of us have new worries to deal about when working from home. There‚Äôs the issue of internet connectivity, office VPNs slowing down speeds, along with the distractions of social media and other services.One must also factor in that since there is a lockdown, many of us are constantly scrolling some screen or other, be it the phone or desktop or even the smart TV in the living room. Since we can no longer leave our homes, the screen inevitably becomes the only source of entertainment, and it might be a good time to put some restrictions in place so that you can at least focus on other activities to keep yourself distracted.We look at the tools you can rely on for screen management available on Android and iOS devices, along with other apps that can be useful during this period.Google introduced the ‚ÄòDigital Wellbeing‚Äô feature with Android Pie and it is available on most smartphones now. This is one of the most useful tools to restrict your usage of certain apps, and helps you gain some control if you are too addicted to the phone.The Digital Wellbeing feature can be found in the settings apps on Google Pixel phones, and any other device running Android Pie and above, including popular phones from Samsung, Redmi, Realme, and other brands.You can go to Digital Wellbeing in the Settings app of your smartphone and set up the Dashboard to put a time limit on each of your apps. So if you feel you are spending too much time scrolling on Facebook or Instagram, you can see a timer. Once the timer is set and you exceed the daily limit for the day, Android will then block your access to the app. The lowest limit you can set is 5 minutes, going up all the way to 24 hours.Of course, there is the option of resetting the timer, and regaining access, but one advantage with the dashboard is that you can screen out some of these apps during your work day, so you are not distracted by these during the designated work hours. Once you are done with the day, you can go to Settings and reset the timer to gain some more access should you wish to do so.The good thing with Google‚Äôs Digital Wellbeing feature is that you can individually put a limit on each app. So if you feel you are spending too much time on Netflix or Instagram, you can restrict them individually.Read our others tips regarding work from home and internet connectivityInternet not working properly? How to check the speed and fix it | Boosting your WiFi signal strength |¬† Download these video calling apps if you‚Äôre working from homeAnother feature of Digital Wellbeing which might be useful in these stressful times is the Wind Down. This will implement a Night schedule from a select time period, say 10 pm to 6 am in the morning and ensure your phone does not keep buzzing with notifications. The screen goes to a grayscale, which is easier on the eyes, and Do Not Disturb (DND) mode is turned on automatically during this time.There‚Äôs also a Focus Mode, which will pause distracting apps when you need to focus during a fixed period. So you can set a schedule, say during your work hours and choose apps that should be locked down. During that period, Android will stop access to these apps, the icon will get greyed out till focus mode is on. This can be beneficial if you find games, social media apps distracting during work hours.Apple‚Äôs iOS and MacOS users also have the option of introducing limits on their apps with Screen Time, which was introduced with iOS 12. This will let you choose restrictions for apps based on categories, unlike Android which has options for individual apps.Screen Time lets you set limits for Social networking, Games, Entertainment, Creativity, Productivity apps, and on websites as well. The only problem is that sometimes apps that get tagged in a category might not really be used for that purpose. One example is WhatsApp, which will be tagged under social networking, but many offices might be using it to coordinate. So you might find some apps get locked out, even though you want access to them all day.But there is a solution. In the Always Allowed segment, you can go down and choose Apps for which you do not want any downtime or locking out.Another useful feature is Downtime, which you can customise. During this time, only apps that you choose are allowed and phone calls will be available. You can customise it for days of the week.There is also the option of Communication Limits, which might be particularly useful if you need to set some boundaries for after work hour calls, which can be an issue during work from home. During the downtime, you can ensure that Phone calls, Messages, FaceTime requests are restricted to specific contacts. Screen Time is also available on macOS, though you will have to set it up separately on the MacBook.For those who want to go beyond the standard default options available on the devices, there are apps to offer this kind of control as well. Freedom is one such app, which is available on iOS, Android, MacOS and Windows 10 as well. But it is not free, and you get only seven free sessions. After that the service costs $6.99 per month or $2.42/month if you get it for one year, There‚Äôs also a $129 offer for forever, though right now it is retailing at $64.50 as part of a discount.With Freedom, you can start a session and block all distracting websites and apps on your PC or MacBook while working. You can set the duration for how long these should be blocked, and it will ensure greater focus when you are working from home. You can set the duration for each session and the site will be blocked for that period.App Detox is for those of you who are still on older versions of Android, or find that the Digital Wellbeing feature is not enough to help you. The app will let you choose apps from which you want a detox, and will let you decide from specific daytimes on specific days to number of launches to usage time for a particular app.It will also let you decide if you want to stay away from an app for a number of days. There‚Äôs also the more drastic, ‚ÄòFOREVER‚Äô option, if you decide you don‚Äôt want to use this app again. This is only available on Android.Moment is an app on iOS users for those who need more and Screen Time is just not helping. So when setting up the phone it will ask you what you want to do be it track screen time to stop wasting time to reduce anxiety. There‚Äôs also a Moment Coach to help you use the phone less, though it will cost Rs 689 per month. The app also has courses, though you need to subscribe into order to access these features.Here‚Äôs a quick coronavirus guide for you to stay updated: Who all should be tested for Covid-19 and when? | How should you quarantine yourself? | How often (and how) should you clean your home? | What is the Janata Curfew announced by PM Modi? | Who are restricted from coming to India, and from when? | How long can the virus live on surfaces or in air around you? | Still more Coronavirus Q&A Explained news here

The platform has seen users begin to mention COVID-19 and Coronavirus more and more in their profiles. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre experiencing a major lifestyle change at the moment and we‚Äôre focused on helping our users shift the dating app experience to an in-app dating experience,‚Äù the spokesperson said.READ: How food delivery services are coping with coronavirus pandemicPopular dating app Tinder is also trying out ways to engage users.

https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/techook/phones-launch-redmi-realme-vivo-xiaomi-6327783/,Redmi K30 Pro to Realme Narzo 10 series: Here are phones launching in India this week,2020-03-23 14:56:28+05:30,"It‚Äôs only the third month of 2020 and there have been numerous smartphone launches in the country, giving users more choices to select a phone. However, smartphone manufacturers aren‚Äôt done yet. There are more devices lined up to be launched than you would have thought.We are listing down the phones that are launching this week.

https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/opinion-technology/xiaomi-blog-mi-10-launch-coronavirus-chaos-6327591/,The Xiaomi Blog: A Mi 10 launch in the times of coronavirus chaos,2020-03-23 13:44:19+05:30,"These are unprecedented times. Most of India, in fact, most of the world, is in a lockdown. Essential services are the only ones allowed, and suddenly everyone you know is working from home. So it does seem like an odd time for smartphones to launch, but then as they say the show must go on, even if it is taking place online.For Xiaomi it will be a big one, the Mi 10, its first flagship phone in India since the Mi MIX 2 launched back in 2017. And it comes at a very turbulent time. For one, Xiaomi has already given plenty of indication that the Mi 10 is a premium device with a higher price, likely higher than the China variants, which are starting at Yuan 3999 or roughly Rs 40,000.The messaging has been clear: This is not an affordable flagship and Xiaomi India head Manu Kumar Jain has laid out the exact reasons for this as well. One is the increased GST from 12 per cent to 18 per cent, two being that this is a direct import, meaning unlike other Redmi phones, this is not made in India. Third, is a depreciating rupee, which is bound to make everything worse. This could very well explain Jain‚Äôs tweet today about the rupee at 76.06 followed by the teary-eye emoji.Add to that the impact that the coronavirus lockdown will continue to have on the Indian economy and global economy as a whole, means the Mi 10 is unlikely to have an auspicious launch. And it won‚Äôt be the only phone that faces this.ALSO READ: Mi 10 is coming, but will Xiaomi‚Äôs flagship dreams finally succeed in India?Xiaomi will be hoping that things play out very differently, but there‚Äôs no doubt that even without the existing crisis, breaking into the premium segment has been a challenge for them. I can‚Äôt help but think of previous premium flagships from the company and how they fared in India.The Mi 5 when it launched in 2016 was a reasonably priced flagship at Rs 24,999 and was competing with phones like the OnePlus, given the specifications it offered. But it failed to set the market on fire, unlike the affordable Redmi phones. The Mi MIX 2 in 2017 failed to do any better for the company, despite being a unique and innovative phone with a full-screen display and that too priced under Rs 40,000.Express Tech is now on¬†Telegram. Click¬†here to join our channel (@expresstechnology)¬†and stay updated with the latest tech newsAfter that, it seemed Xiaomi had given up on launching its Mi branded flagships in India. But in 2020, the Mi 10 is supposed to change all of that. On paper, the Mi 10 with its 5G capabilities sounds like an excellent flagship. It has the high-end Snapdragon 865 processor, a 108MP camera, which so far only Samsung‚Äôs Galaxy S20 Ultra is offering, 50W fast-charging, and a premium design. But numbers show that breaking into the premium segment is more than just a specifications game in India.In the ultra-premium, Apple still dominates, and hence the year-old iPhone XR continued to be a best-seller in India in 2019. Then there‚Äôs Samsung and OnePlus, which have segmented their brand positions in this segment of the market. For the Mi 10, the challenge won‚Äôt lie in the device‚Äôs performance or specifications. But rather, in convincing users that this is the premium phone to consider, over say the next OnePlus or the existing Samsung flagships, or even the iPhone 11, which is retailing at discounts.üì£ The Indian Express is now on Telegram.

https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/covid-19-internet-speeds-worldwide-ookla-numbers-6327624/,COVID-19 and internet speeds across the world: What Ookla‚Äôs numbers show,2020-03-23 12:34:10+05:30,"The coronavirus pandemic has come with new constraints for internet connectivity all over the world as more and more people move to a work from home format. With users across the world, including India, now relying on their home broadband lines to carry out work tasks and for their daily entertainment, there‚Äôs bound to be an impact on internet speeds given the strain. We have listed out some tips to make sure you get the most out of your WiFi.Ookla, which is known for its Speedtest app, has now released numbers on the trends they have observed during this outage. Here‚Äôs a look at what the numbers show.India typically does better on the fixed line broadband speeds, and mobile internet speeds are where we continue to lag. According to the February 2020 data from Ookla, when the coronavirus threat was not so severe, India‚Äôs mobile data ranking was 128 with an average download speed of 11.83 Mbps, while upload speeds stood at 4.61 Mbps.In the fixed line broadband department, India was doing slightly better with a ranking of 69, though this does represent a drop of three places. The download speeds stood at 39.65 Mbps, while uploads were at 37.09.So what happened once the coronavirus outbreak took place, especially in the beginning of March? Ookla‚Äôs data shows that fixed broadband download speed increased very slightly between the weeks of March 2 and March 9, just hitting 40Mbps for downloads.But mobile download speed remained flat during this week, so the positive here is they have not fallen too much. However, data for the rest of March is yet to be made available, and it would be interesting to see how the trend plays out, given that most of India which relies on fixed broadband is now working from home.ALSO READ: Five simple tips to boost Wi-Fi signal while working from homeALSO READ: Coronavirus pandemic pushes up internet usage; how to monitor excessive broadband useData from Ookla shows that mobile download speeds in China improved between the weeks of March 2 and March 9, while mobile download speeds in Hubei province during the week of March 9 were relatively flat.The country saw a dip in fixed broadband performance due to the outbreak. China saw decreased download speeds and higher latency, including in the Hubei province, starting the week of January 13, 2020. Ookla notes that while mobile performance is steadily improving in China overall, mobile download speeds in Hubei are still low.Given Italy is the worst hit during the pandemic with the highest death toll right, and with the country under lockdown, it is having an impact on internet speeds as well. In February 2020, Italy‚Äôs average fixed broadband line download speeds stood at 62.70 Mbps.Data shows that the mean download speed on both mobile and fixed broadband have declined between the weeks of March 2 and March 9 in Italy overall, and in the Lombardy region specifically. Again this is the region in Northern Italy which is the worst impacted and under lockdown.Latency has also increased on mobile and fixed broadband in Italy as a whole and on fixed broadband in Lombardy. The data showed decrease in the speeds from the week of February 17, once the outbreak started to grow.The United States is the third worst hit country in the list of those impacted by the pandemic, with cities like New York, San Francisco declaring lockdowns early on. Now, these have been extended to the entire state of California, New York, Connecticut and Illinois.In February 2020, the average fixed broadband speeds in the country stood at 137.34. Data from Ookla shows that San Francisco saw its mean download speed over fixed broadband decrease in the week of March 2 and 9.However, mobile download speeds increased during the same period. Ookla says the speeds for both fixed and mobile broadband are varying within a normal range through the week of March 2 in all areas of the United States, and they will update with more analysis later on.After Italy and the United States, Germany and Spain have seen the highest level of infections. In Germany, mean download speed over fixed broadband decreased slightly between the weeks of March 2 and 9. In Spain this decrease started earlier in the week of February 24 till March 9. France which has over 16,000 cases has also seen download speeds decline in the same week.üì£ The Indian Express is now on Telegram.

With everyone sitting at home and using the internet for work, streaming movies and shows, playing games and more there‚Äôs a chance you might see your internet speeds drop significantly compared to the last few weeks given the strain on networks.So what should you do to fix the speed? Giving people can‚Äôt stop using the internet given it is the only means of entertainment right now, we explain what steps you can take should the problem arise.To check the status of the internet speed of your broadband connection you can simply download the SpeedTest application on your Android phone or iPhone. Or you can go to the Speedtest website on your desktop as well. Open the app after it has been installed and click on ‚ÄúGo‚Äù option shown in the middle of the phone screen. The app will take a few seconds to test and show the results of the internet speed of your broadband connection.ALSO READ: Five simple tips to boost Wi-Fi signal while working from homeALSO READ: Coronavirus pandemic pushes up internet usage; how to monitor excessive broadband useWe tested the speed of the broadband connection we are using a couple of times, and mostly the download and upload speeds were at par.

However, we would recommend using a stable broadband connection if working from home given mobile data can finish in a day or two leaving you with no internet connection at all.The easiest and the most common way out is to reboot the router. This often helps fix several operational issues. If the speed doesn‚Äôt recover despite rebooting the router you must cut down on streaming movies, playing games, and other sources of entertainment and prioritise work. This will boost the net speed, but definitely escalate an already high level of boredom.Express Tech is now on¬†Telegram.

Offices are asking their employees to work from home for a period which might be escalated to two or three more weeks. In this scenario, a proper Wi-Fi connection is mandatory to carry out your work duties.You might have invested in a good broadband connection but there may be some problems which could slow down the internet speed. We are listing out ways to boost your Wi-Fi signal while you work remotely from your home.READ: Internet slow? Here‚Äôs how you can check your internet speed¬†If you are receiving signal only when you are standing right next to your router, you need to change its location. The placement of the router can affect wireless coverage. For better signal strength, place the router in the centre of the house, away from walls.

Also, make sure there are no electronics near the router.If you have a dual-band router, make sure to configure it for optimum performance, which might be the 5GHz band instead of the more common 2.4GHz band. The higher band offers faster speeds and encounters less interference from other wireless networks and devices.

https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/amazons-bezos-tells-workers-coronavirus-will-get-worse-6326687/,Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos tells workers coronavirus will ‚Äòget worse‚Äô,2020-03-22 15:45:24+05:30,"Amazon.com Inc Chief Executive Officer Jeff Bezos warned his company‚Äôs 800,000 employees that the coronavirus outbreak will likely ‚Äúget worse before it gets better,‚Äù according to an open letter shared Saturday on his Instagram account.The letter follows cries from US lawmakers and his own employees that the world‚Äôs largest online retailer isn‚Äôt doing enough to protect its warehouse workers and delivery drivers who endanger themselves delivering products to Amazon customers looking to avoid stores.‚ÄúThis isn‚Äôt business as usual, and it‚Äôs a time of great stress and uncertainty,‚Äù Bezos wrote. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs also a moment in time when the work we‚Äôre doing is its most critical.‚ÄùBezos‚Äô letter, his first public comments about the outbreak, comes when lawmakers and regulators around the country are making decisions about which businesses are essential and should keep operating, and which ones should close down so employees can remain at home and reduce their exposure to the outbreak that has infected more than 300,000 globally and killed at least 13,000.Amazon has seen a surge in demand from customers ordering baby formula, hand sanitizer and medical supplies. It announced plans to hire 100,000 workers to meet demand and is temporarily boosting pay among its warehouse employees and instructed its contract delivery partners to also raise wages for drivers who don‚Äôt work directly for Amazon. Key rival Walmart Inc. is also hiring workers and doling out bonuses to staff helping it meet demand.Both companies face criticism from lawmakers, workers and activists for not doing enough to protect hourly workers on the front lines of the crisis. The pressure ramped up Friday when a group of workers from Walmart, Amazon and other big retailers, called United for Respect, demanded paid leave for those affected by the coronavirus outbreak and better protective measures from their employers.Amazon on Saturday announced hourly workers in its US delivery network would receive double pay for every hour they work in excess of 40 each week, effective March 15 through May 9. That follows temporary raises of $2 per hour that will be in effect through April.Coronavirus pandemic: How the delivery ecosystem is coping up with new challengeMonica Moody, a 22-year-old Amazon warehouse worker near Charlotte, North Carolina, said she and her fellow employees don‚Äôt have adequate protective gear or sufficient time to wash their hands during their shifts. She argued that the warehouse should close temporarily to be sanitized.Also on Friday, four Democratic senators, led by Cory Booker of New Jersey, wrote to Bezos asking that the company implement more aggressive safety measures and offer more hazard pay to its employees. The letter cited news reports in the past week in which workers at the front lines of Amazon‚Äôs logistics network raised concerns they didn‚Äôt have the time or resources to protect themselves as they helped speed packages to customer doorsteps. The Amazon delivery drivers in California told Bloomberg they received one single disinfecting wipe to clean vans before the start of their shifts.Bezos said the company has increased cleaning in its facilities and implemented instructions for employees to maintain a safe distance from one another, and continues to meet daily to address safety issues. Getting proper equipment remains a challenge, he said. On Wednesday, Amazon reported the first confirmed case among its U.S. warehouse workforce ‚Äî at a delivery station near New York‚Äôs LaGuardia Airport.Coronavirus pandemic: Ola Share, Uber Pool services suspended temporarily‚ÄúWe‚Äôve placed purchase orders for millions of face masks we want to give to our employees and contractors who cannot work from home, but very few of those orders have been filled,‚Äù Bezos said.‚ÄúMasks remain in short supply globally and are at this point being directed by governments to the highest-need facilities like hospitals and clinics,‚Äù he added. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs easy to understand why the incredible medical providers serving our communities need to be first in line.

With the general scare over stuff being delivered to your doorstep also becoming carriers of the coronavirus, food delivery apps like Swiggy and Zomato have started training their restaurant and delivery partners on how to package and handle food, wash and sanitise hands, use masks and identify symptoms. But then those who do the last-mile servicing are not finding it easy to incorporate the masks and hand sanitisers into their daily routine.‚ÄúI am looked at suspiciously when I deliver food these days, especially if I am not wearing a mask,‚Äù says Rajneesh, a delivery valet working with a food delivery service. He says his company hasn‚Äôt instructed their employees to take any particular measures nor have they received any mask to put on.

We are getting so many orders, some of the stocks are for up to six months,‚Äù he said.While Nikhil‚Äôs work has increased, another delivery boy who delivers for a meat shop is seeing ‚Äúno order‚Äù days now. He blames the rumours related to poultry rumours for the rapid decrease in demand. ‚ÄúI receive several messages on WhatsApp about how chicken consumption can make you more vulnerable to coronavirus,‚Äù he said, adding: ‚ÄúEven my family tells me not to touch chicken and other non-veg products.‚Äù India‚Äôs poultry industry is looking at a 41 billion loss because of this drop in business.But there is also the fear of ending up on the receiving end ‚Äî of catching the virus, or worse, becoming a ‚Äúspreader‚Äù. ‚ÄúI come in contact with so many people and products daily,‚Äù reasoned Sakeb, another delivery valet.READ: Coronavirus prevention: Here‚Äôs how Zomato and Swiggy are fighting COVID-19Meanwhile, the food delivery apps are going the extra mile to preserve their business.

https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/opinion-technology/the-apple-blog-why-ipad-pro-has-me-excited-6326312/,The Apple Blog: Why the new iPad Pro has me all excited,2020-03-22 11:31:35+05:30,"For all the gadgets I have used and tested, I don‚Äôt get much excited when I hear of a new product or launch. But there are exceptions and one such exception was this week with Apple‚Äôs announcement of the new iPad Pro. And there is a good reason why it got me rubbing my hands in anticipation.Over the past couple of years, thanks to a mixture of reasons ‚Äî a lot of travel for work and a bad back that does not keep up to the pressures ‚Äî I have moved to the iPad as my primary computer when on the move. Yes, at home I use my MacBook Air and at work I have a Windows PC, but at work outside Delhi, in an airport, in a plane and in a hotel room, I‚Äôm always using the iPad Pro.Why I‚Äôm stuck with the iPhoneAnd I can do everything on the iPad, as I have been for close to a decade now, from writing articles, to editing and even filing copies on WordPress. But there is at least one thing that I don‚Äôt enjoy doing on an iPad and that is working on a spreadsheet.And this is the primary reason why the new iPad Pro with its TrackPad support with the latest version of iPadOS.Let me elaborate. Every week there are a few things I have to do on spreadsheets, updating reports, creating snapshots and the like. And often I am on the road when these need to be done. And over time I have realised that there are things that are really tough to do just using touch. Selecting a particular cell, for instance, can get irritating, also copying a certain part of a large sheet. And I have gradually started avoiding this on the iPad.However, with the new iPad Pro, you have the new Magic Keyboard with its trackpad and you can pretty much do everything you do on a proper laptop. You can move the cursor exactly where you want, using the trackpad and not the screen. And you can select more precisely now. Finger-licking good for iPad users like me.Also, with the new iPadOS Apple is rethinking the cursor itself. Why does the cursor have to be a vertical line, especially in a touch environment? So the Apple cursor will be a round, ‚Äújust like your fingertips‚Äù. Even how this cursor will interact with buttons and elements on screen is being rethought. All very exciting for an iPad user.Can you guess which are the top-selling smartphones in the world?Also, I have been noticing how Apple is moving its iPad more towards the laptop experience in recent times, even as its MacBooks tend to add more mobile experiences. In fact, with an iPad Pro this good and effective, I am surprised Cupertino is still investing in the MacBook Air. If the functionality is the same ‚Äî maybe the iPad Pro has more power now ‚Äî why not just move all to the iPad form factor.The MacBook Air now costs Rs 92,900 onwards and the iPad Pro base model with the not-so-cheap Magic Keyboard totals just under Rs 1,00,000. I would rather opt for the latter, after all this is 2020.

https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/techook/as-coronavirus-pandemic-pushes-up-home-internet-usage-heres-a-guide-to-monitor-excessive-broadband-use-6325556/,How to monitor excessive broadband use while working from home,2020-03-24 12:11:34+05:30,"As more families choose to stay home and avoid stepping out because of the coronavirus outbreak, the usage of internet data has seen a dramatic increase. With millions of people working from home and family members spending more time streaming TV shows and movies, doing live video chats and watching live news, a new situation of internet overload has emerged.In fact, the European Union has asked Amazon, Netflix and YouTube to switch to SD streaming during peak hours. Although the move is temporary, it‚Äôs a reminder that internet networks are overloaded and there might be a situation when home broadband speeds dwindle further due to surge in demand. Industry experts are warning people to monitor their broadband usage to prevent internet overload as no one knows when the coronavirus pandemic will subside.Here are some easy to do tips to keep your broadband usage in check.Before anything else, you need to know how fast your internet is. A speed test will verify that your ISP is able to deliver the speed that is promised. You never know the service provider is charging more for the plan which you have opted for. If that‚Äôs the case, then you should call your ISP and ask to fix your internet speed. The best way to do so is by visiting Ookla‚Äôs Speedtest.net.Here‚Äôs how to check your home broadband speed*Connect your computer to Wi-Fi or use a router using an ethernet cable.*Open any browser, be it Chrome or Firefox.*Navigate to Speedtest.netThe benefit of Speedtest.net is that it will show your download and upload speed. This is the easiest way to measure your internet speed. Keep in mind that internet speeds fluctuate many times a day, so it‚Äôs advisable to do multiple tests in order to find your connection speed.READ: How to check internet speed and fix it if slowBut it‚Äôs not enough to check your broadband speed alone. These days people spend more time on their phones and binge on Netflix, watch YouTube videos or stream music through apps. So it is important to test how much internet speed you get on a phone. Ookla offers the Speedtest app for iPhone and Android.Now that you know how fast or slow your internet connection speed is, you can easily decide on whether you want to continue with the existing ISP or switch to another ISP.Do not jump the gun and decide to change your ISP immediately. If you found out that you are not getting the speed promised by your ISP, call the customer care number and try to fix the issue. If your ISP can‚Äôt solve the issue, check out other ISPs in your area and compare plans, what is the monthly data cap before you sign it, promised upload and download internet speeds and customer service. Estimate a rough internet bill in your mind, before finalising your next internet provider.Whether you are planning to switch to a new internet provider or continuing with an existing ISP, keep track on how much internet speed and data you need now and in the near future. This will help you monitor your usage of internet and broadband consumption at home. There are three ways to do it. The simple way is to compare the old and current bill. It can be done by logging into the internet service provider‚Äôs website.5 tips to boost Wi-Fi signal during working from homeAnother way is to figure out how fast your internet speed is currently and monthly data consumptionon. You cannot deny the fact our broadband usage and reliance on the internet has increased. And on top of it, we use multiple connected devices at our homes, including our smartphones which are always connected to Wi-Fi. The point to remember here is that one connection is shared with all the devices to your network. The more devices you own, the more speed you will need.The decision to increase the internet speed or to opt for a broadband plan with extra data also depends on how you and your family consume the internet. In a household, where the entire family binge-watches Netflix and where kids own PlayStation or multiple laptops and mobile devices, we are looking at the activities that require more data, thus requiring a faster internet to support streaming and gaming. And if we consider a household with two family members that casually browse the internet but are more into social media, we are looking at the entire set of activities. They might not need a Giga speed internet connection or a plan with unlimited data. For them, even a broadband plan with 20Mbps speed and 100GB a month would be sufficient.Download movies in SD instead than HD: If you stream or download movies from platforms Netflix or Amazon Prime Video on smartphones, you can save some data by choosing SD over HD. You probably won‚Äôt notice the difference when watching a movie in SD over HD on a smaller screen. Netflix has, in fact, offers the Rs 199 mobile-only that gives you access to all the content at SD instead of the standard HD resolution.Stop videos from automatically playing on Facebook: The Facebook app consumes a lot of mobile data in the background, thanks to those autoplaying videos, but you can stop them from playing.*Open your Facebook app.*Tap the three stacked lines at the bottom of the screen.*Select ‚ÄúSettings & Privacy‚Äù followed by ‚ÄúSettings.‚Äù*Scroll down and tap ‚ÄúMedia and Contacts.‚Äù*Select ‚ÄúAutoplay.‚Äù*Choose ‚ÄúNever Auto-play Videos.‚ÄùUse Wi-Fi when possible: Turn off Wi-Fi when you are not using them. You can check whether your laptop, iPad or smartphone is not using Wi-Fi by looking for the Wi-Fi symbol that is characterised by three curved lines at the top of your phone screen. If you do not see that symbol, you can go to the phone‚Äôs settings for what Wi-Fi networks are available nearby. Similarly, switch off cellular data on smartphones when you are at home and instead log in to a stable Wi-Fi connection.üì£ The Indian Express is now on Telegram.

Called the COVID-19 CTI League, for cyber threat intelligence, the group spans more than 40 countries and includes professionals in senior positions at such major companies as Microsoft Corp and Amazon.com Inc.One of four initial managers of the effort, Marc Rogers, said the top priority would be working to combat hacks against medical facilities and other frontline responders to the pandemic. It is already working on hacks of health organizations. Also key is the defence of communication networks and services that have become essential as more people work from home, said Rogers, head of security at the long-running hacking conference Def Con and a vice president at security company Okta Inc.The group is also using its web of contacts in internet infrastructure providers to squash garden-variety phishing attacks and another financial crime that is using the fear of COVID-19 or the desire for information on it to trick regular internet users.‚ÄúI‚Äôve never seen this volume of phishing,‚Äù Rogers said. ‚ÄúI am literally seeing phishing messages in every language known to man.‚ÄùPhishing messages try to induce recipients to enter passwords or other sensitive information on websites controlled by the attackers, who then use the data to take control of bank, email or other accounts. Rogers said the group had already dismantled one campaign that used a software vulnerability to spread malicious software. He declined to provide details, and said that in general the group would be reluctant to reveal what it was fighting.Rogers said law enforcement had been surprisingly welcoming of the collaboration, recognising the vastness of the threat. Rogers is a UK citizen based in the San Francisco Bay Area. Two other group coordinators are American, and one is Israeli.‚ÄúI have never seen this level of cooperation,‚Äù Rogers said. ‚ÄúI hope it continues afterwards, because it‚Äôs a beautiful thing to see.‚Äùüì£ The Indian Express is now on Telegram.

The candidates have been preparing for the exam amidst the 21 days lockdown in their homes taking online classroom sessions and online test series. However, fraudsters are equally active in this period trying very hard to trick the aspirants and steal money.UPSC CSE candidates often receive promotional messages from coaching institutes marketing their preparation material and fraudsters also ride along with similar messages. But this time, cybercriminals are sending alerts to aspirants regarding ‚Äúimportant notification released due to Novel Coronavirus‚Äù with a link. We checked the link and here‚Äôs what we found.The URL takes you to a website where there is no such notification but an advertisement for test series. ‚ÄúDue to COVID-19 all students Please stay home. Our Expert Team Specially Designed Tests and study material. For all UPSC CSE 2020 aspirant [sic].‚ÄùThe website mentions that their test series is designed by ‚Äúprofessor from top university due to COVID-19‚Äù in order to help poor students. Usually, the price of IAS (Prelims + Mains) test series is priced at Rs 40,000 but the website claims to offer the test-series for as little as Rs 699, which is also refundable within 48 hours.The website also claims to offer free Netflix subscription ‚Äúdue to COVID-19‚Äù.With just a simple look at the website and its grammatically incorrect sentences makes it clear that this isn‚Äôt a legit website but is a scam. However, the domain ‚Äúiitmadras.online/upsc.html‚Äù ends up making it look authentic for some users ‚Äî especially to marginalised aspirants who don‚Äôt have enough money to enroll with a test-series program run by reputed coaching institutions. We dug deeper to find the truth of the site.According to who.is, the domain was registered on August 21, 2019 by one Rudra Pratap from Guntur, Andhra Pradesh and expires on August 21, 2020.Once you click on registration link on the web page, it takes you to another website wooe.in ‚Äî a fairly looking site claiming to offer test series for multiple competitive exams at a nominal fee with the promise of a refund. In my investigation, I found that the refund never really happens and the claims are false just to trick aspirants. Following are some screenshots of users who complained about the portal on Quora and consumercomplaints.in:I also discovered that to build its image as a genuine test series provider, Wooe has built a net of positive reviews around the internet including a long list of praises on Quora. Users who posted positive reviews of Wooe.in at Quora also claimed that it is run by IIT Madras.However, IIT Madras has denied its association with any such portal. Following is the notice issued by the IIT Madras:Wooe is not alone in running fake test-series or online coaching programs with prices too real to be true. Somehow, they get a hold of mobile numbers of government job aspirants and send them messages promoting their fake services. Unfortunately, lots of users fall for it and lose money.* If it‚Äôs too good to be true, it‚Äôs probably a scam. There is no way, a private organisation will provide Rs 40,000 worth of test series for Rs 699, that too with free Netflix subscription for a year.* If the message or website in question has grammar mistakes, it is probably fake that has been built in haste for the sole purpose of scamming people.* Look at the URL carefully. Most of these make-shift websites register a domain that gives it an impression of association with a reputed institute‚Äî in this case, IIT Madras. Check for the association. If IIT Madras would have been providing test series, you can find it with a simple Google Search. Also, if you just search IIT Madras, you will get to know that the institute‚Äôs URL is iitm.ac.in and not iitmadras.online.* Don‚Äôt trust random educational portals. Do your research before subscribing to any test-series or online course. In the case of Wooe, it is not easy to identify it based on its website alone but the cheap test-series amount should ring a bell in your head.Express Tech is now on¬†Telegram.

https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/mobile-tabs/before-razr-motorola-was-testing-tablet-style-foldable-phone-design-6332576/,"Before Razr, Motorola was testing tablet-style foldable phone design",2020-03-26 15:11:01+05:30,"Motorola‚Äôs original foldable device was a tablet-style phone, before it finalised the design of the new Razr. However, the company felt such a device was too large and thus veered in favour of a more compact, flip-style form factor.‚ÄúWe tested multiple prototypes. We tested a tablet-style too, but we wanted to have an ultra-compact design,‚Äù Prashanth Mani, Country Head, Lenovo Mobile Business Group and MD, Motorola Mobility, India, told indianexpress.com in a telephonic interview.The new Razr is a reboot of the iconic Razr flip phone from 2004. The revamped version, however, is a modern Android smartphone with a screen that measures 6.2-inch diagonal but folds in half. When fully closed, the device easily slips into a pocket.Motorola was first to launch the Razr foldable phone with a clamshell design late last year and soon Samsung followed with the Galaxy Z Flip. The Galaxy Z Flip too has a flip phone-style form factor but features a foldable glass screen and is cheaper than the Razr.Without getting into comparisons, Mani said both foldable phones have pros and cons. ‚ÄúI think both devices have their own uniqueness in this category,‚Äù he said.Like in the case of the Razr, the phone has a secondary 2.7-inch OLED screen on the outside of the clamshell for notifications when the phone is closed. The Galaxy Z Flip, in contrast, has a tiny 1.1-inch pill-shaped external display that is limited in functionality. The Razr is impressively thin and the hinge that allows the phone to lay completely flat. But where the Galaxy Z Flip scores over the Razr is on the display front and internal hardware. The Galaxy Z Flip is also cheaper in comparison to the Razr.‚ÄúThe design defined Razr for us. In every decision point, the look and feel of the device were kept in mind. So we have succeeded in our view in creating a device that embodies our code philosophy, simplicity, surprise, and richness,‚Äù he explains. Mani said it took the company four years to design the Razr and the team worked closely with Lenovo‚Äôs laptop team to perfect the hinge.Neither the Razr nor the Galaxy Z Flip is perfect, but many critics have found that the Razr is less powerful in terms of specifications. Some even had a harsh opinion on the average camera performance.Mani has defended the company‚Äôs decision to go with the Snapdragon 710 processor and a single 16MP camera on the Razr that costs Rs 124,999. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs not just about megapixel or megabytes. It‚Äôs also about what the design bodies, what kind of craftsmanship goes into it, and what kind of material is used. We believe that these are things that make a phone premium today,‚Äù he says. He said that as the price band goes up, the most important thing people consider in a phone is the design language and craftsmanship.Whether a consumer chooses the Razr or the Galaxy Z Flip, both phones have fascinating new technology that‚Äôs largely untested on a large scale, and these phones are expensive to manufacture. Despite the high price of the Razr, Mani believes there is a set of customers who would want to spend the money on a foldable phone. ‚ÄúThe market is big enough for foldable phones,‚Äù he said confidently.¬†The new Razr‚Äôs Rs 124,999 price includes 18 per cent GST, which has increased the cost of the device in India. Fluctuation in the exchange rate and local duties have further added to the retail price of the Razr. The phone has been made in China and not in India, where Motorola manufactures its other smartphones.Mani agrees that the foldable devices are in the early stages and it will take some time to see the growth in the category. ‚ÄúThe foldable itself is at a very nascent phase but we think the category will grow significantly over the next one or two years,‚Äù he said, adding that the company will continue to invest in the foldable tech and work with our partners to develop further functionalities on it.‚ÄùOne big feature the Razr lacks is the 5G connectivity. Although 5G networks are not going to be live in India this year, if you are going to spend Rs 124,999 on a phone, you might expect the feature to be there in the device. However, Mani said the company‚Äôs priority was to get the foldable phone right and 5G was not something Motorola aimed to add in the Razr.Motorola hasn‚Äôt announced a 5G smartphone yet, but the company is looking at this space closely. In fact, both foldables and 5G are important areas for Motorola in the coming years.Mani was tightlipped on the company‚Äôs next foldable phone, but he did say that the team is evaluating multiple designs and form factors. Virtually every smartphone maker is working on foldable smartphones and trying to perfect the technology.The new Razr, which was intended to go on sale from April 2 in India, could be delayed further due to the three-week pan-India lockdown. The country has been put under complete lockdown for 21 days in an aim to curtail the spread of coronavirus in the nation of 1.3 billion people. Flipkart, the exclusive online partner to sell the Razr, has temporarily suspended operations in view of the 21-day lockdown. The phone was also supposed to be available from the top 200 offline stores in India.üì£ The Indian Express is now on Telegram.

Apple, for instance, sells a device that also makes apps viewable on TV.Reluctance to share more data with Google could be a factor as well.Google said Chromecast usage rose in recent weeks versus a year ago and that the company continually encourages apps to adopt its free casting software.

This week we have seen competitors Xiaomi and Realme delay the launch of Mi 10 and Nazro 10 series as PM Narendra Modi announced 21-day lockdown in India. In the last month several tech companies have delayed their upcoming launches due to fears over COVID-19. Apple is said to join the list as the company might postpone the launch of its upcoming iPhone.A new report coming from Nikkei suggests that Apple is planning to delay the launch of 2020‚Äôs flagship iPhones. Recently the Cupertino major canceled the WWDC physical event and moved it to online only. WWDC will take place in May this year.Like every year, Apple was expected to launch the new iPhone aka the iPhone 12 series in the fall. Three iPhones were rumoured to arrive this year as well including iPhone 12, iPhone 12 Pro and iPhone 12 Pro Max. But sadly given the situation right now it is highly likely that Apple could delay the launch of the new iPhones.READ: iPhone makers suspend India production due to lockdownSources close to the development of the new iPhones told Nikkei that Apple is worried that people might not be interested to upgrade to the upcoming 5G iPhone amid COVID-19 outbreak. The report further clarified that the launch of the new iPhones could be delayed by ‚Äúmonths‚Äù.No exact timeline has been revealed as yet but some reports suggest that the launch could maximum be delayed by November this year. Apple is yet to confirm any details on the delay. Everything clearly depends on the situation in the coming months.iPhone 12 Pro Max: What is Sensor-shift stabilization and how does it work?Supply chain constraints due to coronavirus could be one of the key reasons behind the delay in Apple keynote this year. Due to COVID-19 Apple has shut all factories as well as stores around the world. Apple manufacturing units in China are closed since last month when the pandemic hit the country majorly and the company couldn‚Äôt risk its worker‚Äôs health.READ: Apple may start reopening stores in first half of April‚ÄúSupply chain constraint aside, Apple is concerned that the current situation would significantly lower consumer appetite to upgrade their phones, which could lead to a tame reception of the first 5G iPhone,‚Äù Nikkei quotes a source close to the development.Apple is yet to talk about the launch delay as yet but given the on-going situation, the delay in iPhone 12 series launch is highly likely.

WhastApp has no official feature that lets you read messages that have been deleted but via third party app called WhatsRemoved+ it is possible for you to read all deleted WhatsApp messages.Oftentimes, mainly while switching to a new smartphone, we lose old WhatsApp texts, media files and that can be very disappointing for some. Today we will discuss a simple way so no one ever loses their WhatsApp chats no matter how old they are.We all know that WhatsApp backs up chats every day. For the unaware, WhatsApp creates a backup of all chats at 2AM in the morning by default unless you have changed the setting manually.ALSO READ: Here‚Äôs how you can read deleted WhatsApp messagesNote: If the daily backup is getting too much you can always change the auto chat backup setting and select the option that best suits your requirement. The options available are: Daily, Monthly, Weekly, and OFF. If you choose OFF option, you will never be able to get access to old chats if switched to a new phone.*¬†You will first need to ensure that the chat backup option of your WhatsApp account is set to Daily. This option makes the process smoother as it keeps a backup of your chats on a regular basis and make it easy to recover it whenever required.*¬†We mostly need to recover deleted WhatsApp messages while switching to a new smartphone or deleting the WhatsApp account.* If switching to a new smartphone you will first need to download the WhatsApp app from Google Play store or Apple App store.* Login to your WhatsApp account by entering the phone number, OTP.ALSO READ: Using WhatsApp to work from home? Keep these 8 things in mind then*¬†After setting up the app¬†you will get an option to ‚ÄúRestore‚Äù all your WhatsApp chats.* Click on the Restore option and all your old/deleted WhatsApp messages will be restored on your new smartphone.Note: You must ensure that any message received after the backup time can‚Äôt be restored.If you are not moving to a new phone but have mistakenly deleted some WhatsApp chats and want to restore it back you can simply uninstall the WhatsApp app and reinstall it and follow the aforementioned process.While restoring you must ensure to connect the phone to a stable WiFi network so the restore process doesn‚Äôt consume all your mobile data.Work from Home appears to be the norm for many of us. We at Indian Express tech have some articles which could help make this easier. First, how to optimise your WiFi, which is really important. Read on that here. Next, we explain how to save data on WhatsApp given we might be using a lot more of this. Then we explain how you can balance screen time while doing work from home.

Plus India is in a 21-day lockdown. One easy and simple way to best some of this stress is to play video games. Studies show that video games also help us improve our response timings and cognitive thinking. Here we will be recommending a few games for you to play during all this free time, with no bar on the gaming product you own.Give most of are now dependent on our mobiles, let us first list out games you can play on the smartphone itself to keep the mind occupied. You can also check out our earlier list on the best games you can play while in self-quarantine.PUBG MobilePUBG Mobile is one of the most popular games across the globe on both iOS and Android. It is also a very easy game to get a hold off. I recommend that you start playing this game, as it has a different mode for every kind of player, like Team Deathmatch, Battle Royale and more. It will also give you the chance to chat with your friends while they play from their homes.Ludo StarIf you want to reminisce about your childhood, when your friends used to come over and all of you would play Ludo, you can download Ludo Star. This game allows you to play Ludo with your friends wherever they are and chat with them via voice or text. You can also play the game with your family members or roommates. You can also connect with random people and make new friends.Asphalt 9: LegendsAsphalt 9: Legends is a pure racing game, that will be able to give you most of the thrill that a real race car would be able to. Asphalt 9: Legends is the best the series has to offer as of now in terms of graphics and controls. Another feature is that they also have a licence from a lot of car companies to use their car names and designs. Thus, providing you with the extra bit of realism.Subscription service (PlayStation 4, Xbox One)My first option would be to get the PlayStation Plus or Xbox Gold service as it will provide you with a number of free games that you can play during this quarantine. It is more fun as you do not know which games will come up the following month, hence helping you grow as a gamer, by pushing you to play different genres of games.The Last of Us (PlayStation 4)Read the name of the game. Yes, that is what it is. Sure coronavirus is not turning people into hideous monsters, but it is no joke.¬† This game will help provide you with a vent as you try and stay alive in a post-apocalyptic Earth where you‚Äôre likely to be killed by other humans. This game might make people anxious about the future, so we recommend that you play this with caution.Resident Evil 7: Biohazard (PlayStation 4, Xbox One, PC)Resident Evil is a series that comes to any gamers mind, when you say the word zombie. And why would it not, it is one of the best zombie games there is, with the right amount of thrill, horror and storyline.Why I chose this version to recommend you is because in this you are trapped in a home, with the Baker family that is very bad at social distancing and is confirmed to be infected. It‚Äôs one of the best horror genre games that I have played to date. A bonus point would be if you would happen to have a PS VR, to play it on. The horror just intensifies.Tom Clancy‚Äôs The Division 2 (PlayStation 4, Xbox One, PC)This game can be is the most relatable in the current scenario. Your character is a part of an elite squad must re-establish peace in a lawless America, set in the aftermath of a viral (weaponised smallpox). To some, it might feel borderline offensive. So play at your own risk.FIFA 2020 (PlayStation 4, Xbox One, PC)To get out of the dark and gritty, you can play the new FIFA 2020, which has been developed by Volta and EA in collaboration. This collaboration provides us with two games at once, FIFA Street and FIFA. This helps the gamers change to a different version of FIFA when bored. It is quite an interesting and fun game that helps you have the fun of watching football even when there are no football matches taking place.NFS Heat (PlayStation 4, Xbox One, PC)If racing games is your genre then NFS Heat is the game that you need to play. It brings back the memories that you might have made while playing the original NFS Most Wanted. It is basically Most Wanted on steroids with better graphics and controls. However, not all is good and the fact that you need to shift between day and night and complete some missions in between just make the game a tad bit boring.Assassin‚Äôs Creed Odyssey (PlayStation 4, Xbox One, PC)Assassin‚Äôs Creed Odyssey is a very long game (40+ hours), so you won‚Äôt be running out of the storyline anytime soon. And it basically lets you do what any other Assassin‚Äôs Creed game allows you to do, and that is jumping, exploring and assassinating. It a fun game, and even though I have not completed it, it intrigued me enough to recommend it to everybody.The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the WildThis is a game that tells the story as to what happened when Link is trying to repair the damage that happened during a 100-year-old war that Link and Princess Zelda lost against Ganon. There is a lot of exploration that is needed to be done and it has an interesting story line that can provide you with a fun time during this lockdown.Pokemon Sword and Pokemon ShieldPokemon games that are available for Nintendo consoles are extremely engaging and fun. The last Pokemon game I played was Pokemon Black and from what I have seen in the trailers, it is a must have game. With it you get to travel the fictional Pokemon world, capturing various different Pokemons and then battling it out to be the best.Super Mario Maker 2Mario has been one of the most popular video game characters owned by Nintendo ever since its first game was launched. The character since then has been featured in multiple game series. Super Mario Maker 2 lets gamers create their own custom courses using assets from various games across the Super Mario franchise and then play them themselves or share them online for others to play. It reminds users of the older days, when they used to play Super Marios Bros on an 8-bit gaming console.üì£ The Indian Express is now on Telegram.

We have already discussed how fraudsters are posing as WHO officials to carry out phishing attacks, tricking people to click on malicious links or download harmful content, registering new malicious websites related to COVID-19, putting up fake coronavirus apps¬†and setting up fake COVID-19 tracking dashboards to hack computers.Now there is a new scam doing the rounds. A new report by Sophos ‚Äî a British security software and hardware company ‚Äî shows that cybercriminals are using extortion emails claiming they will infect a user‚Äôs family with coronavirus if the user does not pay the ransom money.Sextortion is well-known among people where cybercriminals send ‚Äúdirty little secret‚Äô emails saying they‚Äôve got hold of the user‚Äôs compromising pictures via malware and they‚Äôll leak it to the whole world, including their friends and family‚Äî unless the user decides to pay them a hefty amount of ransom money.In the new trend, criminals have tweaked the extortion to match up with the ongoing coronavirus pandemic. Cybercriminals are sending emails asking for $4000 via Bitcoins or else they‚Äôll not only reveal secrets, but will infect every member of the victim‚Äôs family with coronavirus.To sound authentic and get the person‚Äôs attention, the sender first reveals the password that was previously used by the victim. They claim they know all the passwords and that they have been keeping a close watch on the user, and could even infect their family with coronavirus. The email also includes a threat to reveal all of the user‚Äôs secrets. Check out the whole email in the screenshot attached below:There‚Äôs a chance they could have extracted your password from publicly available data leaked in an old data breach. So even if the whole this is a scam, what do to now? Paul Ducklin, the Principal Research Scientist at Sophos, explains that there is no need to be scared. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt send any money.

https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/after-scrapping-mobile-world-congress-organiser-gsma-offers-refunds-6331442/,"After scrapping Mobile World Congress, organiser GSMA offers refunds",2020-03-25 19:11:15+05:30,"The organiser of the world‚Äôs biggest mobile technology conference, MWC 2020 in Barcelona, will offer refunds or discounts to future gatherings to the tens of thousands of attendees and companies that had paid to attend February‚Äôs canceled event.
MWC was an early major casualty of the coronavirus pandemic, and it had never been scrapped in its 33-year history. By removing it from the calendar, telecom heavyweights lost a significant opportunity to generate marketing buzz around their latest wares. The industry‚Äôs biggest players often spend tens of millions of dollars to exhibit at the show, and smaller ones pay in the hundreds of thousands.On Wednesday the GSMA, the trade body for the mobile technology industry, said in a statement it will offer full refunds to all attendees for the cost of their tickets, which cost 799 euros ($865) for a basic admissions pass. For large exhibitors, the GSMA wants to incentivize discounts on attending the show in future years as an alternative to claiming large refunds.Mats Granryd, the director general of the GSMA, said in an interview with Bloomberg at the time MWC was canceled that the trade body was ‚Äúlooking for solidarity‚Äù and everybody bearing their own costs.It looks like that may be happening, to some extent. Some large operators have already expressed to the GSMA their intention to participate in MWC next year, according to a person with direct knowledge of the situation. These include Orange SA, Telefonica SA, Vodafone Group Plc and NTT Docomo.Larger companies will get the option of receiving a credit worth 125% of what they paid to exhibit at this year‚Äôs show, which will be applied as a 65% discount on the cost of attending next year, plus 35% and 25% discounts on the two subsequent years respectively.Alternatively, they can claim refunds equivalent to 50% of their spend for MWC 2020, up to a maximum of 150,000 pounds ($178,000).For smaller exhibitors ‚Äî those who spent up to 5,000 pounds ‚Äî a full refund will be offered. However, these firms can also opt to waive a refund and instead be granted a 125% credit and three years of discounts.Companies that had canceled their attendance prior to the GSMA calling of the show will be offered credits and discounts, but not cash refunds. The GSMA‚Äôs board is made up of executives from a number of the world‚Äôs biggest operators, including Vodafone and Deutsche Telekom AG, who agreed to the initial cancellation. The GSMA isn‚Äôt expecting its operator members to seek refunds.About 80% of the GSMA‚Äôs annual budget is derived from the money it generates from MWC Barcelona, according to two people familiar with the group‚Äôs budget.But internally, executives don‚Äôt consider the cancellation of MWC 2020 and Wednesday‚Äôs offer of refunds to be an existential threat, according to an executive with direct knowledge of board-level conversations who didn‚Äôt want to be named discussing private matters.üì£ The Indian Express is now on Telegram.

https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-reviews/mi-dual-driver-in-ear-earphones-review-balanced-audio-at-a-budget-6331406/,Mi Dual Driver In-ear Earphones review: Balanced audio at a budget?,2020-03-26 12:48:10+05:30,"The Indian consumer puts a lot of emphasis on bass when it comes to audio preferences that‚Äôs why a lot of manufacturers focus primarily on lows in their speakers and headphones. However, it has led to the neglect of mids and highs in earphones‚Äî at least in the budget segment leaving you no with no choice, but to shell out more money to go for a premium offering for balanced audio.That‚Äôs the problem Xiaomi claims to have solved with its Mi Dual Driver In-ear Earphones, but is this affordable product able to deliver what it claims? The product is priced competitively at Rs 799 and here‚Äôs what I think about the product after a month of usage.Right from the get-go, the Mi Dual Driver In-ear Earphones remind of the Realme Buds 2. It has a braided cable, the earpiece sets have magnetic ends, the mic is affixed on the right cord with volume rockers and play/pause buttons.Although Realme‚Äôs offering looked more premium than Xiaomi‚Äôs product, there are few things that I liked in the Mi Dual Driver In-ear Earphones. These are light-weight earbuds; I could use the earphones straight for three-hours without feeling the urge to take them out. The plastic cover over the magnetic end that saves the paint from scratches. Also, there is kevlar-style design underneath the plastic and it looks quite good.The anodized aluminium earbuds have a matte finish that is fingerprint-resistant and looks good too‚Äîespecially the blue-coloured variant. The earbuds tips are angular in shape and ensure a better fit. You also get additional tips in the box with different sizes so you can switch them with the right size.The overall design looks sturdy and the braided cable prevents the wires from tangling. I kept the earphones in my pockets and laptop bag and never had to struggle to untangle it. The Mi Dual Driver In-ear Earphones come with an L-shaped connector that is definitely more practical.The right cable in the Y-splitter carries the microphone and remote which falls within the reach. The buttons are tactile and the mic works just fine. Also since the mic hangs at the right height, you do not need to adjust it while receiving or making a call.Coming to the sound quality, Mi Dual Driver In-ear Earphones come with Dual Driver ‚Äî one 10mm and another 8mm Dynamic Driver. Xiaomi says that one driver handles the low frequencies while the other takes care of mids and highs. However, in practical usage, I did not feel much of a difference.The Mi Dual Driver In-ear Earphones are mostly bass-heavy and you can feel the strong lows while listening to bass-centric tracks. People who like strong bass will definitely like this.Express Tech is now on Telegram. Click here to join our channel (@expresstechnology) and stay updated with the latest tech newsI was really hoping that Xiaomi‚Äôs claims regarding the efficient handling of mids and highs come true, but looks like there is much work to do. The highs are acceptable, but mids are not that clear as the bass boost spills over here. You can feel the effect even when you listen to podcasts.Overall, the Mi Dual Driver In-ear Earphones do not offer a balanced audio experience but are perfect as a daily driver and for bass-heavy soundtracks. For those who want budget earphones under Rs 1,000 can definitely consider Mi Dual Driver In-ear Earphones for its light-weight design and bass-heavy performance.üì£ The Indian Express is now on Telegram.

https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/cold-flu-or-covid-19-this-ai-tool-can-help-you-differentiate-6331334/,"Cold, flu or Covid-19? This AI tool can help you differentiate",2020-03-26 21:16:52+05:30,"The coronavirus is confusing for the common man, since its similar to any common flu. And this creates confusion about who can, or should, get tested. To tackle this problem, Sydney-based Medius Health has created Quro, a risk assessment tool to determine whether you should be tested for Covid-19 or not. The AI digital health startup run by Indian Abhi Bhatia has so far done more than 75,000 consultations since rolling out the tool on March 4 in India and Australia.‚ÄúWhen Covid-19 hit, we had enough understanding of how we can utilise our medical knowledge graph at the backend and developed an AI-powered risk assessment tool which presents the users with questions related to symptoms and risk factors in accordance with the World Health Organisation protocols and guidelines,‚Äù the founder of Medius Health told indianexpress.com over phone from Sydney.Quro, an AI-based risk assessment tool, is like an anonymous consultation where people do not need to sign up or give personal details. The tool, which acts as a virtual health guide, asks a number of questions such as your travel history, past medical history, your symptoms, what sort of problems you are having right now from a symptomatic point of view and so on. The tool is free to use and can be accessed on the web.But collecting the data is one part of the story, says Bhatia. His team, which consists of data scientists and clinical scientists, has created an artificial intelligence (AI) system called disease frequency and evoking strength that extracts the data and using different combinations, it understands the relation between symptoms and disease. And based on that, its AI system predicts whether a person is at higher risk for getting sick from Covid-19 or not.The system gets updated frequently, based on the data and the trend provided by the World Health Organisation (WHO) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). ‚ÄúWe keep on updating the prevalence rate value of those relationships between coronavirus and a particular symptom. So for instance, when coronavirus started picking up, the doctors realised that nasal congestion is the one thing that actually differentiates between a flu as well as coronavirus, but then a lot of things have changed,‚Äù he said.Bhatia said the aim was to ‚Äúquell the panic‚Äù and at the same time offer ‚Äúthe right set of information‚Äù so that people should know that this could be a mere cold and flu and not Covid-19. He further added that the tool will help identify those people who have a high risk of Coronavirus and need to get the testing done.The tool [Quro] will help people understand how to differentiate between symptoms that are more relevant to coronavirus versus influenza. That is the biggest problem right now because everyone who‚Äôs coughing and has some sort of nasal congestion, they feel that it‚Äôs a coronavirus and it‚Äôs creating a lot of panic among people,‚Äù he explains.Citing the example of India, Bhatia said the risk assessment tool could be useful for a country with a population of 1 billion, where unnecessary fear among people about Covid-19 can put a lot of burden on hospitals and healthcare institutions.According to Bhatia, 69.2 per cent of people from India who have accessed the risk indicator have lower chances of contracting Covid-19, 22.7 per cent of profiles fall in the moderate risk category and just 9.1 per cent of people are at a higher risk of complications from the deadly virus.Bhatia feels that the tool can help government agencies and health organisations in understanding the magnitude of Covid 19 and take necessary steps before it gets too late to stop it from spreading.The company has reached out to the Ministry of Health to push out the risk assessment tool to a large population base in India. Meanwhile, Medius Health is working with a couple of partners in India to deploy the tool, including ICICI Prudential and Bajaj Financial Services. The company is also developing a special platform for Max Healthcare.It took Bhatia and his team 8-9 days to develop the tool. ‚ÄúBefore we roll out any AI tool, we train the model and then we have to do internal testing. In this case, we created different kinds of case simulations that we picked up from Wuhan. For instance, who was traveling, where these people were traveling, what was the age group, what was the gender, what geographical patterns that they have, what was the onset of symptoms? So we picked up that data from WHO and created AI-driven case simulations that we then injected into our platform,‚Äù he said.At a time when the developed countries like the US and Italy are failing to stop the coronavirus outbreak, Bhatia acknowledged that the use of Artificial intelligence (AI) can be a game-changer in healthcare.‚ÄúAI comes into play as early detection, collecting the data on a mass scale so that we can create epidemiological population-level information through which the government can allocate the resources at the right place, and put people in the right bucket. So if there‚Äôs a high-risk person, he should be the one who should be isolated first and get proper testing done,‚Äù Bhatia said.He further that those data points will further help train models and the AI engine would even be able to predict within those high-risk people who are least touched to coronavirus and who are more prone to infectious disease.Medius Health, which was founded in 2017, has a team of 32 people including data scientists, doctors and software engineers. The startup has so far raised AUD 4.2 million in two rounds and is looking to close its Series A from a consortium of investors from India and Singapore.üì£ The Indian Express is now on Telegram.

https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/coronavirus-internet-speeds-slow-netflix-hotstar-amazon-prime-youtube-reduce-streaming-quality-6331237/,"Coronavirus impact: As internet speeds fall, streaming services forced to dial down quality",2020-03-26 11:02:43+05:30,"The coronavirus pandemic is breaking the internet, in every sense of the word. Trends observed by Ookla, known for its SpeedTest app and website, show that across the world fixed broadband and mobile broadband networks are seeing a decline in their speeds, ranging from 10 per cent to 20 per cent in some cases. The reason: more and more people are now in lockdown, working from home, and with children staying back as well, there is increased burden on networks.One major factor for this is video, according to Doug Suttles, Co-founder and General Manager at Ookla. ‚ÄúOver half of the internet uses video. Anything else is small in comparison. The issue is that everyone‚Äôs working from home and suddenly kids don‚Äôt have school and they are home too. There‚Äôs a whole lot more video consumption. It‚Äôs gotten a lot larger,‚Äù Suttles explains, adding that ISPs cannot add capacity overnight to their networks.To give some context, JustWatch, an international streaming guide, has seen a 60 per cent spike in traffic from India and 81 per cent from US. So world over streaming services are now working to reduce the load. In India too, most major streaming players have followed suit and announced measures.YouTube, for which India is the biggest market in terms of consumers, confirmed Tuesday it was reducing its default video quality to standard definition across the world. In India, YouTube streaming will be at 480p on mobile networks by default until April 14, which is when the official lockdown declared by the government is supposed to end.‚ÄúWe continue to work closely with governments and network operators around the globe to do our part to minimise stress on the system during this unprecedented situation. Last week, we announced that we were temporarily defaulting all videos on YouTube to standard definition in the EU. Given the global nature of this crisis, we will expand that change globally starting today,‚Äù a Google spokesperson says on this change.Read our guide on how to ensure that streaming websites don‚Äôt consume all your data¬†Other players in India like Sony, Facebook, Amazon Prime Video, Viacom18, Zee, Hotstar, TikTok and MX Player have also agreed to stream at SD or standard definition content, in order to ensure there is no strain on the networks, which will consume less data.In a collective decision, the companies have announced they will temporarily be defaulting HD and ultra-HD streaming to SD content or offering only SD content at bitrates no higher than 480p on cellular networks. The measures will stay in effect till April 14.Meanwhile, Netflix has decided to reduce load on the telecommunications networks in India by 25 per cent, while maintaining the quality of service for the next 30 days. ‚ÄúGiven the crisis, we‚Äôve developed a way to reduce Netflix‚Äôs traffic on telecommunications networks by 25% while also maintaining the quality of our service. So consumers should continue to get the quality that comes with their plan ‚Äì whether it‚Äôs Ultra-High, High or Standard Definition,‚Äù says Ken Florance, VP Content Delivery, Netflix in a statement.Work from Home appears to be the norm for many of us. We at Indian Express tech have some articles which could help make this easier. First, how to optimise your WiFi, which is really important. Read on that here. Next, we explain how to save data on WhatsApp given we might be using a lot more of this. Then we explain how you can balance screen time while doing work from home. Also these video calling apps can be useful when relying on work from home. Don‚Äôt let it be all about work, you can rely on these fitness apps to continue that workout during the lockdown. And finally some general tips to keep in mind while working from home. So if a customer wants to continue streaming at a higher resolution, and their plan allows the option, the content will be available at that UHD or HD or SD resolution, except the streaming will be at a lower bitrate. The company has removed the highest bandwidth streams in order to reduce load on the networks.While on-demand video streaming platforms are working to reduce the load on networks, there‚Äôs no doubt that the increased demand has impacted speeds in India already. The good news is that Ookla‚Äôs numbers showed that while fixed or wired broadband has declined at some level in India, it is not so sharp.But mobile broadband has seen a steeper decline of about 10 per cent across networks. The data shows that in India there is also a 5 per cent decline in upload speeds for mobile and fixed broadband as well.‚ÄúThe trends are similar in India to what we are seeing over the world. Week-over-week, there‚Äôs a clear uptick in testing. People are concerned with their network, having issues and wanting to solve those problems. In India, we are seeing about a 10 per cent decline in performance for mobile broadband networks, though the fixed broadband networks have not seen such a sharp decline,‚Äù Suttles says.The decline in mobile networks is not surprising if one looks at the numbers put out by the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) on the number of subscribers for mobile vs fixed broadband. Wired broadband connections stood at 19.13 million subscribers as seen on December 31, 2019. In contrast, the number of mobile broadband subscribers stands at 642 million. For many mobile is the primary and only form of internet connectivity and in these congested times, the networks will face an increased burden.More around coronavirus impact on the tech worldSamsung, Oppo, vivo shut down factories in India | Coronavirus outbreak is impacting Indian smartphone market | From Kerala, a robot to take care of coronavirus patientsIn countries where work from home has been mandated, and is being followed, there is a 10 to 20 per cent reduction in performance. ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs different in some countries is that it has affected mobile broadband more. India is an example of that. In the United States, it has impacted fixed broadband but mobile speeds have stayed the same,‚Äù explains Suttles.Another trend that Ookla has observed is that there is a general uptick in the number of people running speed tests to check on internet quality. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs interesting because usually it happens more often in the evening for fixed broadband when people come home from work. People are testing throughout the day and night now. More mobile tests used to happen typically during the day, but now we are seeing all kinds of tests throughout the day,‚Äù he adds.It is not just video streaming services that are working to optimise their services. Content Delivery Networks (CDN‚Äôs) such as Akamai are also working to reduce traffic congestion.Akamai announced it will work with leading distributors of software, particularly for the gaming industry, including Microsoft and Sony, to help manage congestion during peak usage periods. Gaming software downloads account for large amounts of internet traffic and it will be crucial to manage this, especially as more people are staying home.Express Tech is now on Telegram. Click here to join our channel (@expresstechie) and stay updated with the latest tech news‚ÄúAkamai‚Äôs intelligent edge network architecture is inherently designed to mitigate and minimise network congestion, and because we have deployed our infrastructure deep into carrier networks, we can help those networks avoid overload by diverting traffic away from areas experiencing high levels of congestion,‚Äù a statement quotes Dr Tom Leighton, the CEO and Co-Founder of Akamai.In regions where demand is creating bottlenecks for customers, Akamai will be reducing gaming software downloads at peak times, and completing the downloads at the normal fast speeds late at night. The approach, it says, will ensure that while gamers can still get their downloads, health workers will not face any issues with the digital services that are vital.Another consequence of the lockdowns is more usage of VPN or Virtual Private Networks, which can help users access websites or content which might not be allowed in their country. According to ExpressVPN, it has seen an increase of 21 per cent in the average global usage of its service since the end of February. In India, there‚Äôs been a growth of 15 per cent in VPN usage.‚ÄúWe are seeing strong demand in our services as more people spend more time indoors and employees around the world telework,‚Äù says a statement from Harold Li, vice president, ExpressVPN.But how long will the strain on the networks continue? The Ookla co-founder gives the example of China and how the situation played out there, where the coronavirus outbreak began and was followed by a lockdown in Wuhan.‚ÄúSix weeks ago, China looked like the other parts of the world do now, where everyone shifted to working from home. There were a lot of slowdowns on the internet. It took five to six weeks for things to return to normal there. But as of the last two weeks, it looks like it used to before,‚Äù he points out.In his view, if the lockdowns and social distancing measures are adhered to, and everyone does stay home, it would take a month or so for internet speeds to get back to normal, though he cautions, it will depend on the number of people actually staying at home.üì£ The Indian Express is now on Telegram.

https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/gaming/apples-app-store-rules-limit-rival-gaming-services-while-arcade-runs-free-6331291/,Apple‚Äôs App Store rules limit rival gaming services while Arcade runs free,2020-03-25 17:40:04+05:30,"Video-game fans suddenly have their pick of a huge menu of titles thanks to a raft of new mobile subscription services from Apple Inc, Microsoft Corp, Alphabet Inc‚Äôs Google and Nvidia Corp. But for the more than 1 billion users of Apple‚Äôs iPhone and iPad, the only real option is Arcade, the subscription service launched by the company in September.That‚Äôs because Apple imposes strict limits on the kinds of apps users can access on its devices. For example, App Store guidelines ban services that rely on streaming from the cloud. Arcade adheres to the requirements, in part, because it‚Äôs included as a feature within the App Store itself. This is the latest example of what critics say are arbitrary rules favoring Apple‚Äôs own apps at the expense of similar software from outside developers.‚ÄúThere‚Äôs a fraught relationship between developers and Apple precisely because of rules like this,‚Äù said David Barnard, a longtime independent developer and advocate at RevenueCat. ‚ÄúIn some ways, I am incredibly grateful to their marketplace for helping me make millions of dollars I wouldn‚Äôt have made without it. On the flip side, them being so heavy handed at times does kill apps and does cause developers to miss out on other potential revenue.‚ÄùIf software developers want to reach as many consumers as possible, they have to be on Apple‚Äôs iOS. The operating system powers more than 1 billion smartphones and tablets and it‚Äôs the only way to access the iOS App Store, which accounted for 65 per cent of app spending globally last year, according to Sensor Tower. The Cupertino, California-based company can also make or break mobile gaming businesses: More than half of the $62 billion spent on smartphone gaming last year happened on Apple products.Cloud gaming services, where users stream games live over the internet, are growing in popularity, especially as faster fifth-generation, or 5G, wireless networks proliferate. The new offerings from Microsoft, Nvidia and Google are cloud streaming-based, while Apple Arcade is not. Those other services are found on the Android operating system, which powers 2.5 billion devices worldwide. Among the popular games found there, and missing from iOS, are Red Dead Redemption 2, Gears of War 5 and Destiny 2.Asked about the challenge of reaching iPhone and iPad users with the chipmaker‚Äôs GeForce Now service, an Nvidia spokesperson said: ‚ÄúAsk Apple.‚ÄùApple said its ‚Äúcustomers enjoy great apps and games from millions of developers and gaming services can absolutely launch on the App Store‚Äù if they follow the App Review Guidelines, which means that games have to be submitted individually, allowing them to appear in App Store rankings and search. The company also said it intends to continue building on its relationships with developers and providing a level playing field.‚ÄúDevelopers can choose to reach all iPhone and iPad users over the web through Safari and other browsers on the App Store,‚Äù Apple said. But currently the new cloud-based gaming streaming services aren‚Äôt accessible through web browsers on iPhones and iPads.Whether the restrictions raise antitrust issues is another matter. The policies were in place before the latest gaming services launched, and ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt see it cutting one way or the other,‚Äù said David Reichenberg, an antitrust lawyer at Cozen O‚ÄôConnor.Apple said there is strong competition in every category in which it makes its own apps. Arcade, only available on iOS, is $4.99 per month for more than 100 games and is a growing contributor to the company‚Äôs services revenue, which is important amid a period of reduced hardware sales growth.At least one gaming subscription offering, GameClub, has managed to get on the App Store. It licensed several old-school games, released them all on the App Store as separate apps under one developer account and offers one $4.99 subscription that works across the apps. Still, it was rejected 127 times by Apple before being approved. ‚ÄúThe amount of effort we put into making sure the app played by Apple‚Äôs rules was no joke, it was a huge undertaking,‚Äù Eli Hodapp, GameClub‚Äôs head of business development, said.In February, Microsoft released a beta version of its gaming service, currently dubbed xCloud. It is still in free preview, but is expected to launch later this year as a paid service under the company‚Äôs Game Pass brand. A look at the software shows the contortions that it and other Arcade rivals will have to pull off to get on Apple‚Äôs system. While Microsoft‚Äôs has a catalog of 90 games available on Android, just one, Halo, appears on the iPhone test version. Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft and Mountain View, California-based Google declined to comment.The Android variant of xCloud lets users choose from multiple games built by different publishers. A version of the app on iOS could only have games either developed or exclusively licensed by Microsoft.Apple outlines this in an App Store rule that says ‚Äúgames offered in a game subscription must be owned or exclusively licensed by the developer.‚Äù For example, Microsoft‚Äôs iOS service can offer Halo because Microsoft produces that game, but not Ace Combat from Bandai Namco.This restriction prevents game developers from being able to work with game partners already on other platforms. Apple said Arcade complies with all the guidelines. Microsoft makes several of its own games, but Google and Nvidia would only be able to launch if they exclusively licensed third-party titles. Google‚Äôs Stadia costs $9.99 per month and new games are added monthly. Nvidia offers free and $4.99 per month subscription tiers, but requires a user to login to a Valve Steam account to access many titles.A related guideline bans the subscription services from carrying over upgrades like levels, extra weapons and characters unless they are also available as an in-app purchase in the App Store. Like many other apps, this gives Apple a 30 per cent cut of revenue from developers, while confusing users who play video games on multiple platforms. It also means more overhead for developers.If a developer is able to build or license enough games for a service, they would still be prohibited from releasing an all-you-can-eat gaming subscription service on iOS that works inside of a single app.Many games are available to be downloaded individually from their creators, but consumers increasingly like to subscribe to a bundle of games at a lower monthly price ‚Äî much like they‚Äôd subscribe to Apple Music instead of downloading individual songs or sign up for Netflix instead of buying specific movies.The same rule that bars non-exclusive titles requires that ‚Äúeach game must be downloaded directly from the App Store.‚Äù This means an app can‚Äôt include a catalog of games and must be broken up into separate apps. Apple said the guideline is to prevent games from being added or removed without review. Apple allows catalog apps for magazines, newspapers, music, videos and books.‚ÄúThe App Store was created to be a safe and trusted place for customers to discover and download apps, and a great business opportunity for all developers,‚Äù Apple said. ‚ÄúBefore they go on our store, all apps are reviewed against the same set of guidelines that are intended to protect customers and provide a fair and level playing field to developers.‚ÄùWhile a game developer could feasibly workaround the first few games-related guidelines, Apple‚Äôs decision to block games that stream directly from the cloud is an iOS deal-killer for Microsoft‚Äôs xCloud, Google‚Äôs Stadia and Nvidia‚Äôs GeForce NOW.Apple‚Äôs rules state that ‚Äúthin clients for cloud-based apps are not appropriate for the App Store.‚Äù This type of app does little on the device, with most of the action offloaded to remote data centers, much like how Netflix streams movies. In contrast, each Apple Arcade game runs fully on the device without the need to stream data from the cloud.Cloud streaming works on an early test version of Microsoft‚Äôs app, but if a full app like that was submitted to the Apple App Store it would probably be rejected. Microsoft‚Äôs beta app is available currently to 10,000 users through an Apple testing service called TestFlight, which traditionally follows the same rules as the App Store.Apple says that developers that publish games on the App Store benefit from features like Siri, backups and App Store promotion. Having to build a service without cloud streaming would be a lot more work for traditional game developers and would mean they have to re-create their apps for each platform rather than leverage their existing game libraries.Apple lets devlopers use a technology called remote desktop. This is similar to cloud streaming, but instead of piping in content from a data center, the game is streamed from a Mac, Windows computer, or gaming console. This method comes with a major caveat: users can only stream from a computer or console that they own and the iPhone must be on the same network as the first device. That means you can stream a game in your living room, but not on the bus to work.That has allowed apps like Sony‚Äôs PS4 Remote Play and Valve Steam Link. Microsoft xCloud for Android has a similar option for streaming from an Xbox, but the feature is missing from the iPhone. It‚Äôs unclear why Microsoft didn‚Äôt include it.Major technology companies aren‚Äôt the only ones having trouble getting on the App Store. For months, one app from Shadow, a Paris-based cloud gaming developer, appeared to survive Apple‚Äôs rules. That changed at the end of February when Shadow‚Äôs platform was removed. Shadow relied on streaming games from PCs in a server farm, versus computers owned by users. Shadow said it‚Äôs talking to Apple about getting back on the App Store.

https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/social/facebook-is-just-trying-to-keep-the-lights-on-as-traffic-soars-in-pandemic-6331205/,Facebook is ‚Äòjust trying to keep the lights on‚Äô as traffic soars in pandemic,2020-03-25 20:32:57+05:30,"As the coronavirus spread around the world and people everywhere were ordered to stay home, phone calls over Facebook‚Äôs apps more than doubled. In many countries, messaging on Instagram and Facebook soared by more than 50%, while group calls in Italy jumped by more than 1,000%. And hungry for information, people clicked repeatedly on virus news stories shown by the social network.Inside Facebook, that meant the pressure was on.‚ÄúWe‚Äôre just trying to keep the lights on over here,‚Äù Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook‚Äôs chief executive, said in an interview last week.As airlines, hotels, restaurants and other companies struggle to stay afloat during the pandemic, Facebook is also laboring to cope with the fallout. But unlike those other businesses, the Silicon Valley giant is being strained by the coronavirus in a different way: Its usage is going through the roof.Skyrocketing traffic and a crush of new users are now stressing Facebook‚Äôs systems just as its 45,000 employees are dealing with working remotely for the first time. The company is also trying to keep its users‚Äô data secure while employees who sift through posts to moderate content do so from home. At the same time, Facebook has added to its workload by promising to do more to limit virus misinformation.It is a pressure test moment for Facebook, which has for years grappled with a backlash over privacy and toxic content, but now has a chance to change that narrative and be seen as an essential communications and information tool during the outbreak.‚ÄúThe usage growth from COVID-19 is unprecedented across the industry, and we are experiencing new records in usage almost every day,‚Äù Alex Schultz and Jay Parikh, two Facebook vice presidents working on infrastructure, said in a blog post on Tuesday. ‚ÄúMaintaining stability throughout these spikes in usage is more challenging than usual now that most of our employees are working from home.‚ÄùWhat has saved Facebook‚Äôs network from crashing altogether, Zuckerberg said, was that the virus and the quarantines have had the largest impact in just a few areas where Facebook operates. Facebook is banned in China, where the virus first appeared, for instance.Those areas that have the highest concentration of people using Facebook‚Äôs services during peak hours from home are also spread out by time zone, Zuckerberg said, which staggers the swell of traffic.‚ÄúIt really is a big technical challenge,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre basically trying to ready everything we can.‚Äù He said Facebook had mobilized its engineers to make sure the company has enough computing capacity and adequate support to handle the surges.The strain has been compounded by Facebook‚Äôs workforce adapting to working from home, which had been discouraged in the past.The company‚Äôs executives have long preached internally that face-to-face meetings and in-person collaboration were central to Facebook‚Äôs success. The importance of in-person conversation was so great that employees at offices from Singapore to New York were frequently asked to travel to the company‚Äôs headquarters in Menlo Park, California, for quarterly meetings.That has made the transition to working from home especially difficult, said four Facebook employees who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly.To communicate, Facebook employees were told to use BlueJeans, which provides technology for videoconferencing calls, they said. But they quickly found that calls were frozen, or the video quality so bad that it was hard to make out who was speaking. Many employees instead turned to Apple‚Äôs FaceTime feature, Google video hangouts or Zoom conference calls. Some even built their own version of a video conference call, according to two employees.Issues quickly piled up.Two days into working from home, some Facebook managers sent the engineering teams a message: limit idle chat on work message boards.Facebook employees had been posting on those boards at a record rate, according to one employee. While some workers were sharing tips and best practices of how to set up a home office, others were sharing links to buy heirloom seeds for at-home farming, and instructions on how to sew their own face masks, one employee said.Other snafus surfaced.Last week, a bug within Facebook‚Äôs system began marking thousands of posts by major news outlets like Politico and The Sydney Morning Herald as spam, which resulted in the removal of the posts. It took Facebook a day to correct the mistake, as engineers struggled to communicate remotely with one another over how the bug had been introduced and what it would take to fix it.While they scrambled, rumors spread among Facebook‚Äôs users over the source of the bug, with many accusing the company of censoring people‚Äôs speech. Internally, Facebook managers said that while the bug was routine, the amount of time it took to fix it was not.‚ÄúThis was just a technical error, and we‚Äôre still doing the post-mortem to understand what happened so we can operationalize any learnings from that,‚Äù Zuckerberg said last week.Working from home has also made moderating Facebook‚Äôs posts more difficult. This month, Facebook put its army of global contractors from outside agencies on paid leave. Those contractors, who number more than 15,000, are responsible for sorting through the posts, images and videos that flow through Facebook‚Äôs services on a daily basis to weed out sensitive, explicit or hateful material.As the outbreak spread, contractors were ordered not to come into the office, where they worked on protected networks behind virtual firewalls to maintain user privacy. Many of those contractors do not have the same technology setup at home.Facebook is still trying to figure out how to let the contractors continue working. For now, it is relying on full-time employees, who do not have the training or the time, to moderate the posts themselves.Given that, Facebook employees have been asked to remove only the most sensitive, fringe posts, said one employee. The company also told employees that it would rely more heavily on their artificial intelligence systems to flag and remove posts.‚ÄúI do think it‚Äôs reasonable to expect that for some of the other categories where the severity might not be as imminent or extreme, that we may be a little less effective in the near term while we‚Äôre adjusting to this,‚Äù Zuckerberg said.While Facebook‚Äôs usage is soaring, that may not translate into financial gains. Most of the increase in traffic has occurred on the company‚Äôs messaging services ‚Äî like WhatsApp and Messenger ‚Äî which bring in relatively little revenue. And though more people are using the main News Feed and Facebook Stories in the core app, the company said it wasn‚Äôt immune to a wider pullback in advertising.‚ÄúOur business is being adversely affected like so many others around the world,‚Äù Schultz and Parikh said in the blog post. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôve seen a weakening in our ads business in countries taking aggressive actions to reduce the spread of COVID-19.‚ÄùZuckerberg said Facebook was doing what it could to prepare for the weeks ahead, as it doesn‚Äôt anticipate the issues to abate anytime soon.‚ÄúI‚Äôve never seen anything like this before,‚Äù he said.üì£ The Indian Express is now on Telegram.

According to a new study, these naturally occurring superconducting materials were found embedded inside two distinct meteorites that crash-landed on Earth.Superconductors are important for humans as the material can conduct electrical current without resistance. The material ensures ‚Äòperfect‚Äô conductivity and finds use in a lot of areas. Even though the superconductor inside the Australian meteorite is a known material, its discovery in space debris comes as a shock.Meteorites have been known to deliver minerals to Earth that we have never seen before as well as materials that are older than our Solar System itself. However, this is the first time meteorites crash-landed on Earth with embedded superconductive grains.Also Read | Earth‚Äôs mini-moon left the planet‚Äôs orbit, but there will be more to comeResearchers from UC San Diego investigated fragments from 15 different meteorites using magnetic field modulated microwave spectroscopy to detect traces of superconductivity inside samples.

https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/opinion-technology/realme-blog-narzo-10-10a-launch-amid-coronavirus-pandemic-india-lockdown-6330648/,"The Realme Blog: The Narzo series is coming, but is this a good time? [Updated]",2020-03-25 11:08:20+05:30,"Recently Realme posted a video on its social media channels and everyone thought the company is releasing a music video or something. But no, it was the promo video of a new smartphone series called Narzo. Wait, what? Narzo? What does that even mean? Well, Realme is yet to reveal the mystery behind the name, but it does say that this series is for Generation Z aka the youth.It‚Äôs great that the company is trying different strategies to attract consumers but I feel it is a bad time to launch a smartphone in India given companies are being affected by the closure of manufacturing units and workers unable to come to work.The Narzo smartphone series was said to launch in India on March 26 but it has now been delayed due to 21-day pan India lockdown. Realme is yet to confirm the new launch date.It was supposed to be a recorded launch video as most employees are working from home. However, all this was before Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced a 21-day pan-India lockdown. Most companies have postponed their scheduled launch events to April.Here‚Äôs everything we know about Realme Narzo smartphone seriesRealme has also suspended its manufacturing operations in Greater Noida, Uttar Pradesh from March 21, 2020 due to coronavirus pandemic. The brand also said that COVID-19 will temporarily affect the inventory and supply in the market for some time. This could not just impact the sales of the Narzo series but also all other recently launched Realme phones.With Realme Narzo the company wants to be more than just a camera phone, given that has been its key focus for (almost) all its recently launched phones. It has revealed that both the Narzo 10 and Narzo 10 A will come with a powerful processor, impressive screen, big 5000mAh battery paired with fast charging support. Teasers have confirmed that the Narzo 10 will include four cameras at the back while there 10A will sport three of them.I feel the Realme Narzo series will take a different approach as far as the design is concerned. The teasers show that the Narzo 10 with quad cameras will sport Realme X special garlic and ginger edition like design with vertical lines throughout the rear panel of the phone. I had used the Realme X ginger edition for some time when it was launched last year and feel it‚Äôs still the best-designed Realme phone so far.What is Narzo? What does it mean?The Narzo 10A on the other hand sports a similar design as the Realme power bank with a huge vertically placed logo throughout the back cover. It looks different and unique from other phones from the company.It is still unclear why Realme is bringing a separate smartphone series in India given the market is already flooded with Realme number series, C series U series, Pro series, X series, and X Pro series phones.Note: After this blog was posted Realme informed us that the Narzo series launch has been delayed due to India lockdown. The new launch date hasn‚Äôt been revealed as yet.¬†Work from Home appears to be the norm for many of us. We at Indian Express tech have some articles which could help make this easier.

https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/techook/xiaomi-redmi-k30-pro-vs-poco-x2-6329450/,Redmi K30 Pro vs Poco X2: Which one is better?,2020-03-25 10:19:57+05:30,"Redmi K30 Pro is now official in China, and is the successor to last year‚Äôs Redmi K20 Pro. The K series under the Redmi brand offers flagship-like specifications, but at a more reasonable price, and this is a trend that has continued with the K30 phones as well. So it is not surprising the Redmi K30 Pro runs the Qualcomm Snapdragon 865 processor, which is the high-end variant for this year.While the Redmi K20 series was launched in India, the K30 series has not yet made an appearance, unless you count the Poco X2. That‚Äôs because the Poco X2 is essentially the re-branded version of the Redmi K30 in the Indian market, and it is quite an affordable phone for what it offers.There‚Äôs no word on whether Redmi K30 Pro will come to India and whether it will have a different name. But the new Redmi phone does raise some interest given what it offers. There‚Äôs also the question of how does the new Redmi K30 Pro phone compare to the previous phone.¬† Given the Poco X2 has the same specifications as the Redmi K30, we are comparing it to the new Redmi K30 Pro. Here‚Äôs a look at the specifications, features of the two phones.Redmi K30 Pro has been launched at Yuan 2,999 (approximately Rs 32,260) for the 6GB RAM/64GB storage variant, at Yuan 3,399 (approximately Rs 36,560) for the 8GB RAM/128GB storage variant and at Yuan 3,699 (approximately Rs 39,770) for the 8GB RAM/256GB storage variant.Express Tech is now on Telegram. Click here to join our channel (@expresstechie) and stay updated with the latest tech newsThe Poco X2 is comparatively much cheaper at Rs 15,999 for the 6GB RAM/64GB storage, Rs 16,999 for the 6GB RAM/128GB storage variant and Rs 19,999 for the 8GB RAM/256GB storage variant.The Redmi K30 Pro is being offered in Moonlight White, Sky Blue, Purple and Space Grey colour options. And the Poco X2 comes in Atlantis Blue, Matrix Purple and Phoenix Red colour options.Both the Poco X2 and the Redmi K30 Pro sport a glass back panel held together by a metal frame. Poco X2 comes with a p2i Splash-Proof coating, which makes it water repellant, however, the Redmi K30 Pro comes with a proper IP53 dust and water resistance rating.Also Read:¬†Poco X2, Redmi K20, Realme X2: These are best phones under Rs 20,000 right nowRedmi K30 Pro comes with an in-display fingerprint scanner, while the Poco X2 features a side-mounted one just like the Samsung Galaxy S10e.¬† Both the devices sport a circular looking camera module trying to mimic the Huawei Mate 30 Pro‚Äôs back camera. But based on the visuals, the Redmi K30 Pro‚Äôs camera looks better.One major differentiator between the two phones is that the Poco X2 has a pill-shaped cut-out to accommodate the front cameras, while the Redmi K30 Pro sports a motorised pop-up selfie camera. One advantage is that pop-up selfie camera does not hinder any content that you are viewing and ensures the true edge-to-edge display experience.Poco X2 does not have a proper pill-shaped cut-out, rather it has two separate holes joined by pixels that have been turned off using the software. This causes the Poco X2 to have a shadow effect near the cut-out.Also Read:¬†Realme 6 Pro vs Poco X2: Which mid-range should you buy?Redmi K30 Pro sports a 6.67-inch Super AMOLED display with HDR10+ support and has a 92.7 screen-to-body ratio. It comes with a 60Hz refresh rate panel according to various reports, however, Xiaomi is yet to comment on that. The device has a 180Hz touch sampling rate, which would make the display capable of at least 90Hz. However, Xiaomi could be holding this back due to software issues and might enable it at a later point with the help of an update.Poco X2 also comes with a 6.67-inch display. However, it uses IPS LCD technology instead of AMOLED technology. Where the Poco X2 pulls ahead is that it comes with a 120Hz refresh rate display. This would make the viewing experience better on the Poco X2, due to the smoothness of the display. It also enhances the gaming performance as there is minimal screen tearing while playing high frame rate games.Also Read:¬†What is Realme Narzo? Is it Realme‚Äôs answer to Redmi, Poco?Redmi K30 Pro comes with Qualcomm‚Äôs flagship Snapdragon 865 processor and comes with what Xiaomi calls as the ‚Äòlargest vapour chamber liquid cooling system.‚Äô¬† ¬†The Poco X2, on the other hand,¬† uses the Qualcomm Snapdragon 730G processor. The processor is good and can handle heavy gaming quite well, making it a good phone. But given the Redmi K30 Pro‚Äôs flagship processor, it will obviously show better results.The Redmi K30 Pro comes with a quad camera setup on the back, which consists of a 64MP Sony IMX686 primary sensor paired with a 13MP ultra-wide-angle lens, an 8MP telephoto lens and a 5MP depth sensor. The camera supports taking images in HEIF and RAW formats, They also support 8K video recording. On the front, it sports a 20MP motorised pop-up selfie camera, just like its predecessor the Redmi K20 Pro.Poco X2 also comes with a 64MP quad-camera setup on the back. This consists of a 64MP primary sensor, an 8MP ultra-wide-angle sensor, a 2MP depth sensor and a 2MP macro sensor. On the front, it has a dual camera setup consisting of a 20MP primary sensor paired with a 2MP depth sensor.Also Read:¬†Confused between Realme 6 and Redmi Note 9 Pro?

https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/techook/save-data-optimise-streaming-on-netflix-amazon-prime-hotstar-youtube-6329658/,"How to optimise streaming on Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, Hotstar and YouTube",2020-03-25 10:23:16+05:30,"If you find yourself exhausting your monthly broadband data or the daily mobile data limits these days, you are not alone. The coronavirus outbreak and subsequent lockdown means more people are working from home. Add to that schools are also closed and with children at home the end result is that a lot more data is being consumed whether for work or for entertainment purposes.Especially for those with children at home, streaming apps or services like YouTube, Hotstar, Netflix, Amazon Prime Video can all act like solid data guzzlers. Already Netflix, Amazon Prime Video have announced they will be reducing streaming quality in Europe, America.But there are settings in each of these apps to ensure that you can optimise your data consumption. We explain how to keep a track for some of the popular streaming services.The good thing about Netflix is that they give out comprehensive details on how much data is consumed based on the settings.¬†According to the help page, watching shows or movies on the streaming service will see the consumption of around 1GB of data per hour at standard definition or 720p. For HD video, this jumps up to 3GB of data per hour. The page also notes that ‚Äúdownloading and streaming consume a similar amount of data.‚ÄùSo how can you reduce some data usage on Netflix? Well, the service has four options for data usage. There‚Äôs low which consumes 0.3 GB per hour per device, followed by medium or SD, which comes to 0.7 GB per hour per device and high which consumes around 3GB per hour. The highest is the Ultra HD or 4K which consumes 7 GB per hour per device.Must read: From Kerala, a robot to take care of coronavirus patientsKeep in mind that the data usage settings only apply to the one Netflix profile. So if there are other profiles, you will need to optimise the data consumption settings for each of them. Follow these steps to optimise your data consumption on the Netflix website.Log into Netflix.comSelect the profile for which would like to change your data usage settings for and select AccountUnder My Profile, select Playback SettingsSelect your desired data usage setting, though the default is usually at auto. Netflix says saved changes will take eight hours to reflect.For managing data consumption on mobile follow these steps:Open the Netflix app.Go to app SettingsSelect Cellular Data Usage or Mobile Data UsageIf it is on automatic, you can switch to the Save Data mode. Or switch to WiFi only.In the Settings menu, there is also an option for video quality. Check if that is at standard or higher. Higher will use more storage when you download content.¬† Netflix says users will not be able to change this setting if they have any pending downloads. Cancel them, and then try again or wait for them to finish.With automatic settings for mobile data usage, Netflix does around 4 hours of streaming per GB of data. The save data setting, brings down consumption per GB to around six hours of streaming on Netflix.

https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/coronavirus-outbreak-testing-the-whatsapp-chatbots-by-who-and-indian-government-6329630/,Coronavirus pandemic: We checked out the WhatsApp chatbots by WHO and Indian government,2020-03-25 15:52:28+05:30,"While the government is trying to contain the spread of the coronavirus pandemic, fake news peddlers are busy spreading misinformation regarding the COVID-19 disease. WhatsApp has partnered with the World Health Organisation and the Indian government to launch two chatbots in order to provide authentic information about the coronavirus.The MyGov Corona Help Desk chatbot for the Indian WhatsApp user has been developed by Jio Haptik Technologies Limited and powered by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare together with the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology.The chatbot developed by WHO provides global information regarding the COViD-19 outbreak and is simply known as the ‚ÄúWorld Health Organization‚Äù.The MyGov Corona Helpdesk can be accessed by adding +91-9013-151515 to your contacts and sending a message or by following this link: wa.me/919013151515. The WHO chatbot can be accessed by adding +41-7989-31892 to your contacts and sending a message or by following this link: bit.ly/who-covid19-whatsapp. I tried both of these chatbots and here is what I found:The MyGov chatbot introduces itself as ‚Äúthe Government of India‚Äôs Coronavirus (COVID-19) Helpdesk to create awareness and help you and your family stay safe‚Äù and straight up shares the emergency helpline number and email address for the Indian users.The chatbot has six options in total:1. Latest Update on Coronavirus in India
2. What is Coronavirus and what are its symptoms?
3. How does Coronavirus spread?
4. How to reduce the risk of Coronavirus?
5. Professional advice by AIIMS-Director
6. Where to get help?Users need to reply with the number written against a query to make the selection.When I pressed 1, the chatbot informed me about the confirmed cases of coronavirus in the country along with active cases, cured or discharged cases, and the number of deaths by COVID-19. However, the information with chatbot does not refresh too often. Even at 3:45 pm in the evening, it continued to show stats from 10:30 am in the morning.In the same message, the MyGov Corona Helpdesk shared the number of testing facilities in the country, along with a link to a document containing state and district wise details of COVID-19 cases. It also had links to the MyGov website and MOHFW website.The response from the chatbot also carried the latest announcement made by the government related to the coronavirus outbreak. In the morning, it shared the lockdown announcement and around 3 pm, it shared information about the Prime Minister‚Äôs address to the nation scheduled at 8 pm.For other responses, the chatbot presented useful information regarding symptoms, spread of disease, and health tips with the help of YouTube videos, graphical pamphlets, and more. It also shared links to videos by Director, AIIMS-Delhi to learn and clear doubts on coronavirus. This can be particularly useful given so many fake videos of ‚Äòdoctors‚Äô are being shared on WhatsApp.If you press 6, the chatbot shares helpline numbers again with an option to view state-wise helpline numbers.The MyGov chatbot and WHO chatbot are not that different, but the latter is aimed at a much wider audience. It presents users with eight options and users need to send the number written before a query to get the information.The WHO chatbot gives you ‚Äúlatest numbers‚Äù of coronavirus patients from around the world as well as new cases reported in the last 24 hours. You can also check country numbers by tapping on the link shared by the chatbot. The chatbot also lists out COVID-19 symptoms together with advisories to ‚Äúprotect yourself‚Äù.It also shares ‚Äúmyth-busters‚Äù as well as ‚Äútravel advice‚Äù. I would urge readers to see these myth-busters in particular, and share them on WhatsApp considering this is authenticated information.With WHO chatbot, users can get the latest news updates shared by the WHO with just a tap. My favourite part of this chatbot was the third option‚Äî ‚ÄúYour questions answered‚Äù. Once you complete all the question-answers, you will feel like an expert on the subject leaving no doubt for any confusion. These reponses cover all aspects of the coronavirus (SARS-Cov-2) and the COVID-19 disease.Express Tech is now on Telegram.

The target amount is $10 million and you can contribute to help WHO-led effort to respond to the pandemic.The coronavirus pandemic has claimed more than 17,000 lives globally, affecting more than 3.8 lakh people.

A few weeks ago Jio, Vodafone and Airtel added a dedicated caller tune on all numbers to spread COVID-19 awareness message among the citizens of India. The caller tune mentions the symptoms of coronavirus and preventive measures one can take.With COVID-19 cases significantly rising in India Jio has now added a ‚Äúsymptoms checker‚Äù option on its MyJio application. The symptoms checker is available on the app starting today. We tried to use the checker on an iPhone first but it wasn‚Äôt available as yet. Jio spokesperson said that the option will come to iOS very soon. It is available on the Android version of MyJio app.READ: WHO health alert on WhatsApp: Here‚Äôs how to connectTo use the feature you will first need to update the MyJio app by heading over to the Google Play store. The banner stating #CoronaHaregaIndiaJeetega can be seen at the top left corner of the app. The symptoms checker asks health and travel-related questions and shows the risk rate of getting coronavirus on the basis of the answers.You will first need to click on the #CoronaHaregaIndiaJeetega banner on the MyJio app and then tap on ‚ÄúCheck your symptoms now‚Äù option displayed on the next screen. Then click on the symptoms checker option on the next screen, there will a couple of questions that you will need to answer.ALSO READ: WhatsApp lets you can easily connect to MyGov Corona helpdeskSome of the questions are as followed: For whom are you taking this test? What is your age group? do you have any of these health conditions? Have you ever visited any of the below countries in the last 14 days? Have you or someone in your family come in close contact with a confirmed COVID-19 patient in the last 14 days? Do you have fever? Do you have cold? and many more.After answering all these questions correctly the symptoms checker shows the result for the risk of getting COVID-19. For us, it showed ‚ÄúLow Risk‚Äù.

https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/from-kerala-a-robot-to-take-care-of-coronavirus-patients-6329400/,"From Kerala, a robot to take care of coronavirus patients",2020-03-25 06:48:07+05:30,"As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to spread in India and across the world, Kochi-based startup Asimov Robotics has developed a robot that can be deployed in hospitals to ease pressure on the medical staff. The three-wheeled robot can carry food, medical and clinical consumables and navigate freely in the hospitals. The robot has been developed in 15 days by a team of seven people.‚ÄúIt is impractical to deploy human-like robots in hospitals. This is why we are working on a cost-effective model which is very practical at this point,‚Äù Jayakrishnan T, CEO of Asimov Robotics told indianexpress.com on phone.Jayakrishnan said the robot is mainly designed to be used inside isolation wards. The robot, dubbed ‚ÄúKARMI-BOT‚Äù, has lower and upper trays that can be loaded with food or sterile containers. Additionally, the robot also disinfects the used items as it comes out of the quarantine zone. The robot also lets doctors or relatives interact with the patients through video calling.Jayakrishnan said the robot has autonomous navigation and can be used remotely as well. The advantage of deploying a robot in this scenario is to cut down on human to human contact. This will help both health workers and visitors.Express Tech is now on Telegram. Click here to join our channel (@expresstechnology) and stay updated with the latest tech newsThe robot is currently being tested internally and fine-tuned at the lab. ‚ÄúIf spares are ready, we can make one robot per day with the current facility itself,‚Äù he said.Jayakrishnan said the interest in the robot is increasing, even though the product has not been out yet. The company has been talking to clients in the US and the Middle East. However, Jayakrishnan is aware that to meet the demand, the firm needs to set up a production line and expand the facility which may take some lead time. For now, though the company wants to focus on the domestic market and its home state.Jayakrishnan declined to reveal how much it costs to make the KARMI-BOT, but said it will be cheaper to produce than the existing robots. ‚Äú US clients are specifically interested in non-Chinese products, which is an advantage for us. Our ultimate aim is to load it with features and bring the cost below Chinese competitors,‚Äù he said.Asimov Robotics, which is incubated within the Kerala Startup Mission, is one of the few high-tech robotics companies from India that focuses on healthcare.‚ÄúOur robots are connected and not standalone products. The robots are connected to the distributed sensor network and use AI and MI to come to a decision and based on that decision, they respond,‚Äù he explains.In China, many hospitals have deployed high-tech robots to deliver food to patients, take patients‚Äô temperatures, deliver medication and disinfect the facility. Similarly, the Spanish government is planning to test 80,000 patients a day using robots in a bid to fight the pandemic.Earlier this month, Jayakrishnan and his team deployed two humanoid robots at the entrance of Maker Village at the Kinfra Hi-Tech Park in Kalamassery to create awareness about the coronavirus outbreak and distribute masks and sanitisers to people who work in the Integrated Startup Complex.Jayakrishnan is also working on a realistic humanoid robot similar to Sophia. The robot, called Chhaya, is able to converse, understand and synthesise expressions.üì£ The Indian Express is now on Telegram.

According to the instructions, he should have gotten a text message with a unique pin for activation of the tracking app once home.But Wong, who hasn‚Äôt left his home, only received a text message after 24 hours had passed. When he tried to activate the app by scanning the QR code and inputting the pin, he got an error message.Wong tried calling the Office of the Government Chief Information Officer, which created the system, but the line was either busy or the person who answered couldn‚Äôt provide assistance. Wong‚Äôs friend who flew back with him encountered the same problem.The Office of the Government Chief Information Officer said in an emailed statement that a small number of people had been unable to receive text messages because of incomplete or incorrect phone numbers on quarantine-order forms. Hong Kong‚Äôs Department of Health plans to follow up on any cases of activation failure, according to the statement.Wong‚Äôs wristband is one of around 24,000 tracker bracelets the government has distributed to monitor new arrivals. The band is meant to connect to an app that sends out alerts asking the person to take pictures of themselves wearing the wristband, and issues warnings if it senses the person had left their place of residence. The device detects and analyzes radio signals, including Bluetooth and wifi, as well as geographical location signals when it‚Äôs activated.Mandatory self-isolation is one of the policies being taken in Hong Kong to curb the spread of Covid-19. The city‚Äôs Chief Executive Carrie Lam on Monday announced the government will also ban all foreign travellers from entering the city for 14 days and prevent bars from serving alcohol.Charmaine Man, a 24-year-old working in film production, is another person affected by the wristband issue. She hasn‚Äôt received any text message since returning to Hong Kong from Malaysia on Saturday. Even though she plans to stay at home for the entire isolation period, she‚Äôs worried about any potential legal risk due to the system‚Äôs failure.‚ÄúThis is a mandatory quarantine, but when I can‚Äôt activate the app, will they consider I‚Äôm breaking the law?‚ÄùScores of people in Facebook groups have also reported the same problem, while there have been photos and videos of people taking their quarantine wristbands on public transport.üì£ The Indian Express is now on Telegram.

However, it turned out to be a brief affair of events as the mini-moon left the planet‚Äôs orbit.2020 CD3 was first discovered on February 15 using the NASA-funded Catalina Sky Survey observatory in Arizona. According to the astronomers, the object may have entered Earth‚Äôs orbit three years ago. Bill Gray, an astronomy-software developer, told the Atlantic that the 2020 CD3 likely left our orbit on March 7. Based on the observations, astronomers believe that the mini-moon could be about 3 to 6 feet wide.It is not confirmed whether 2020 CD3 was a small asteroid or a little chunk from our own moon, broken off in an impact with another space rock.2020 CD3‚Äôs departure did not come as a surprise to the astronomers as it was following an unstable orbit around Earth, meaning it was travelling farther and farther away from the planet until it was able to break free from our planet‚Äôs pull. Currently, it is on its way to follow its original trajectory around the Sun.The discovery of 2020 CD3 is the second instance of astronomers finding a temporary mini-moon orbiting the Earth.

https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/cognovi-panic-index-shows-how-sentiment-on-jobs-spiked-after-coronavirus-was-declared-pandemic-6329321/,Cognovi Panic Index shows how sentiment on jobs spiked after coronavirus was declared pandemic,2020-03-25 17:35:25+05:30,"How does a pandemic impact human sentiments? The Panic Index created by Cognovi Labs, a US-based AI and predictive behavioral analytics company, has shown that in US people‚Äôs fears around employment shot up from 24 to 64 as soon as coronavirus was declared a pandemic and the United States restricted travel from Europe.The Cognovi ‚ÄúPanic Index‚Äù measures people‚Äôs emotional response towards Covid-19 in realtime and it‚Äôs impact on stock markets, dining, shopping, travel and other economic activities. The Dayton, Ohio startup takes advantage of Twitris, a Wright State University-developed machine learning tool, to take a sample of social media happenings about Covid 19 and use a combination of human, machine learning and understanding of behavioral psychology to interpret the conversation and then extract sentiments about what they are searching for in real-time.‚ÄúThis [technology] extracts emotions from free-flowing conversations‚Ä¶maybe any social media chatter if people are posting on blogs or forums or Twitter and it extracts the emotions from that ideally short-form text. It‚Äôs probably the best tool and has the highest capability of extracting emotions of any tool in the world that we‚Äôve seen,‚Äù Colin Butler, Global Revenue Officer, Cognovi Labs, told Indianexpress.com in a telephonic interview.The tool fetches a mix of emotional and non-emotional words based on searches related to the event. For example, in India, Cognovi Labs is relying on the data available on Twitter. These searches can be different from country to country and state to state. As the data updates in real-time, the Cognovi Panic Index shows a different picture of that event, based on people‚Äôs emotional sentiments.Express Tech is now on Telegram. Click here to join our channel (@expresstechnology) and stay updated with the latest tech news‚ÄúThe baseline of the technology is that extracts the emotion and once you have the emotions, we use a proprietary appraisal theory to understand how those emotions combine to predict future action,‚Äù he continues.The decision to create the Cognovi ‚ÄúPanic Index‚Äù was taken a few days ago. ‚ÄúThe index, we created, measures the public‚Äôs emotional state over the coronavirus. Through a dashboard, we can see how the emotionality heats up in different geographical areas. And since people make decisions based on emotions, as the fear heats up, you really understand what the population‚Äôs predilection is towards a certain behavior or maybe how they actually feel about a certain topic,‚Äù he explains.Butler believes that the vast majority of decisions that humans make are based on the subconscious mind and not the logical mind. ‚ÄúIf you are able to extract emotions somehow, you get a predictive window into behavior of people,‚Äù he said. Cognovi Labs has in the past successfully predicted the Brexit referendum hours before the polls closed as well as the results of the 2016 U.S. presidential elections.The core to the machine learning tool, which Cognovi Labs uses to extract emotions from social media chatter and quantifies human behavior to predict the outcome of events, was developed by co-founder Dr Amit Sheth at the Kno.e.sis Center at Wright State University.Cognovi Labs‚Äô AI technology, which took eight years to develop, was funded by the US Air Force, the National Science Foundation, and the Department of Energy. According to Butler, Cognovi Labs has a perpetual and exclusive license to use the technology.Investors of Cognovi Labs include Harvard Business School Alumni Angels of Greater New York, the Ikove Start-up Nursery Fund out of Columbus, and Bossa Nova Capital in Brazil, among others.Butler, who was previously head of business development at a hedge fund and an investment banker with over 20 years experience on Wall Street, says Cognovi Labs‚Äô Emotion AI technology can help governments, corporations, advertisers, marketers and retailers to tweak their future strategies based on people‚Äôs emotions at the time of a pandemic like Covid-19 or any political event.üì£ The Indian Express is now on Telegram.

The tech has been used in smartphones for quite some time.¬†However, Apple‚Äôs upcoming iPhone 12 Pro Max, might be the first smartphone to feature the new sensor-shift stabilization instead of lens-based optical image stabilization.
Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo believes the iPhone 12 Pro Max would benefit from the brand new sensor-shift image stabilization technology when it launches later this year. But what is Sensor-shift image stabilization and what‚Äôs makes it superior to OIS? Let‚Äôs find out.Image stabilization is a common term used in photography. Simply put, Image stabilization (or IS) enables photographers to take blur-free images or videos without a tripod. Any camera with a built-in image stabilization allows you to shoot at slower shutter speeds than one without, delivering a noise-free and sharper image. There are different kinds of Image Stabilization but we stick to sensor-shift image stabilization and optical image stabilization.The Sensor-shift image stabilisation system or IBIS (In-Body Image Stabilization) incorporates a floating sensor that helps counterbalance any movement within the camera. If your camera has IBIS, all of the lenses will also have image stabilization. In-Body Image Stabilization has become popular among the high-end mirrorless camera. A lot of Sony, Fuji and Olympus cameras feature In-body image stabilization. IBIS currently works with interchangeable lens cameras and has yet to launch on smartphones.Express Tech is now on Telegram.

What‚Äôs interesting with OIS is that the image is stabilized before it reaches the sensor, so there is no loss of quality in image quality. This allows the autofocus to function more accurately. Nokia Lumia 920 was the first smartphone to feature OIS.The difference in image quality isn‚Äôt drastic, but the good thing about SSIS is that it can be combined with any lens. That means if Apple manages to bring SSIS to the iPhone 12 Pro Max, all the three lenses would be stabilized. The iPhone 11 Pro‚Äôs ultra-wide-angle lens, for instance, is not stabilized.

It had earlier estimated revenue to be between $825 million and $885 million, an 8.6% rise from a year earlier at the midpoint.The company is scheduled to announce its results on April 30.üì£ The Indian Express is now on Telegram.

At least 75 districts across India were under lockdown to tackle the coronavirus that has infected 415 people and killed seven in the country with health experts warning a big jump could be imminent.Though India‚Äôs Ministry of Consumer Affairs had urged states to allow some e-commerce deliveries to ensure essential supplies, different state notifications created confusion and have marred operations.China‚Äôs Alibaba Group-backed online grocery firm BigBasket said it faced disruptions in many cities as police were not fully aware of certain exemptions announced by state governments for grocery deliveries and had stopped some of BigBasket‚Äôs delivery staff from operating.‚ÄùWe hope things will improve soon,‚Äù said senior BigBasket executive Hari T.N., who urged governments to intervene to allow seamless grocery deliveries in the country.Japan‚Äôs SoftBank-backed grocery firm Grofers warehouses in cities such as Hyderabad, Mumbai, Pune and New Delhi have been ‚Äúforced (into) lockdown‚Äù, said CEO Albinder Dhindsa.Similar delivery or warehouse disruptions hit Amazon, Walmart‚Äôs Flipkart and Softbank-backed e-commerce website Snapdeal across states, industry executives said.The full extent of the disruptions was not immediately clear.Flipkart said there were ‚Äúoperational issues on ground‚Äù and it was working with governments to resolve them while Snapdeal said uniform implementation of the federal advisory would help reduce disruption for buyers.Amazon said it was working with local authorities to ensure goods arrive safely and without disruptions at clients‚Äô homes.

This has also meant that many companies now have to close down manufacturing units in view of the lockdown orders.Samsung, which has its largest factory in Noida, has confirmed it will be suspending manufacturing. It has also implemented work from home for employees. ‚ÄúAt Samsung, health and safety of employees is our highest priority. As a measure to safeguard our employees and their families against Covid-19 and in compliance with directives from the government, we have decided to currently suspend our manufacturing operations and have asked employees at our sales, marketing and R&D offices across India to work from home,‚Äù Partha Ghosh, Head, Corporate Communications, Samsung India said in a statement.Other players like Oppo and vivo have also reportedly suspended their manufacturing operations, though the latter has not issued a formal statement.‚ÄúSafety of our employees is of utmost priority at OPPO. Keeping the recent outbreak of coronavirus in mind, a host of preventive measures have already been undertaken. Operations in our Greater Noida factory have been suspended as per the directive from the government. Additionally, all OPPO India employees have been advised to work from home until further notice.

https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/online-dating-in-a-pandemic-coronavirus-keeps-singles-apart-6328173/,Online dating in a pandemic: Coronavirus keeps singles apart,2020-03-23 18:41:20+05:30,"By Olivia Carville and Nate LanxonStephane, a 32-year-old financier in Manhattan, recently updated his Bumble profile to read: ‚ÄúHealthy male with a strong immune system and robust Purell supply.‚Äù He got a quick reply from a New York woman, who fired back a private message: ‚ÄúTell me your secret‚Äîhow did you get a robust Purell supply? I had to fight a woman at the grocery store for a can of tuna.‚Äù While it was good to hear from another human being, Stephane never responded. Because, well, Covid-19.The novel coronavirus that causes the malady has infected more than 200,000 people around the world and ushered in a fraught new era of online dating. Millennials, trapped under indefinite work-from-home policies and banned from bars, are on dating apps‚Äîswiping, texting, flirting‚Äîmore so than before. Active users rose 8% on Bumble during the second week of March in the US, according to App Annie, which tracks downloads. The big question is how long that will last now that courting in the real world is basically verboten.Dating apps typically run on a freemium model, providing basic services without charge in the hopes that customers will pay more for extra features, such as unveiling who has swiped right on you or applying more granular filters to narrow the dating pool. As social distancing guidelines are rolled out across the US and Europe, dating apps are betting more people will sign up and pay extra to find love‚Äîeven if it‚Äôs virtual for the time being.The bullish view on Wall Street is that users will be willing to spend more time and money on dating apps because they‚Äôve got nothing better to do. The bearish take is they‚Äôll stop paying for extra services because the thought of being within breathing distance of a stranger is more scary than sexy.This month, Brent Thill, an analyst with Jeffries, cut his annual revenue growth forecast from 16% to 9% for Match Group Inc., which owns some of the most popular dating apps in the world including Tinder, OkCupid and Hinge. The shares have fallen 30% over the past month, in line with the S&P 500 Index. ‚ÄúThe big challenge right now is, who wants to go on a date with someone they don‚Äôt know,‚Äù Thill says. ‚ÄúIf I was single, I wouldn‚Äôt want to date anyone right now.‚ÄùNo one really knows how to responsibly date in a pandemic. Some apps are advising couples to meet in open spaces and avoid any form of physical contact; others are suggesting a safer, more sanitary solution: phone sex.‚ÄúWe know it can be a drag being cooped up inside, but there are lots of other ways to have fun: sexting or phone/video sex are great ways to get hot without getting sick,‚Äù the dating app #Open, aimed at couples in open relationships, sent in a message to its 50,000 users on Monday. ‚ÄúThis isn‚Äôt a good time to be swapping spit.‚ÄùLast week, New York Mayor Bill de Blasio was asked how daters should respond to the disaster. That question ‚Äúgoes to the heart of the matter,‚Äù de Blasio said, adding that people cannot get to a point of hopelessness right now. ‚ÄúI do think it‚Äôs fine to have a social life, but you‚Äôve got to exercise some smart rules. If you‚Äôre sick, don‚Äôt go on a date. If the date is sick, don‚Äôt go on the date.‚Äù He suggested keeping a little more distance and said it would be wise even to refrain from kissing one another on the cheek. On Sunday, physically dating in the Big Apple became near impossible as officials closed down restaurants, bars and movie theaters as well as urging residents to stick to strict social distancing guidelines.‚ÄúPeople are feeling isolated, particularly those who are single and can‚Äôt go home to their parents and families,‚Äù says Jordana Abraham, co-founder of Ship, a dating app that allows friends to swipe on behalf of its users. ‚ÄúThey are physically isolated, but not socially isolated.‚ÄùShip says group chat messages exploded 60% nationwide in the past week. Group messages first started ramping up in Seattle when social distancing rules were enforced. They skyrocketed in New York shortly after similar rules were put in place‚Äîwith messages more than doubling in frequency in the past seven days alone.OkCupid has also reported surging engagement and messaging among millennials. People are talking more through the app‚Äîand they are talking about coronavirus. OkCupid saw a 188% increase in coronavirus mentions on dating profiles between January and February. People being people, cringeworthy virus pickup lines are starting to proliferate. As in: ‚ÄúAre you the coronavirus? Because you take my breath away.‚Äù And random hookups are fast being replaced with weeks-long virtual courting, complete with cootie paranoia and forced chivalry.You know who‚Äôs really gonna suffer during this social distancing?Dudes on dating appsWelcome back to courtship, Brad. Welcome back to talking to a gal for WEEKS prior to meeting.We‚Äôre pen pals now, my dude.We bout to get Jane Austen up in here.Now, write me a poem.‚Äî Kaitlyn McQuin (@kaitlynmcquin) March 15, 2020The coronavirus itself even has a mock dating profile, which tells users its hometown is Wuhan, China‚Äîthe epicentre of the outbreak‚Äîand that its major turn-offs are face masks and doctors.Match hasn‚Äôt yet revised its forecasts. The Dallas-based company is monitoring the situation ‚Äúbut can‚Äôt comment definitively on what impact we are seeing,‚Äù a company spokesperson says. Its star performer, Tinder, is also mum on member activity. However, the app, synonymous with a ‚Äúhookup culture‚Äù on college campuses, is urging users to be cautious. ‚ÄúWhile we want you to continue to have fun, protecting yourself from the coronavirus is more important,‚Äù Tinder told to its 5.9 million global subscribers, advising that they wash their hands frequently, carry hand sanitizer, avoid touching their faces and maintain social distance in public.Amsterdam-based The Inner Circle was created for working professionals willing to pay a premium to attend exclusive events, such as cocktail-making classes, jazz nights and ski trips, to meet verified matches. Co-founder Michael Krayenhoff says the virus has presented a wholly unromantic dilemma for the business. ‚ÄúWe had to make a decision as a company to cancel all our events and refund everyone,‚Äù he says.As the pandemic worsened, Inner Circle members began turning to phone calls and video chats. During the first week of March, they were exchanging phone numbers and sending messages about ‚ÄúFaceTime‚Äù and ‚ÄúSkype‚Äù about 30% more often than a month earlier. This led the company to actively promote virtual dating ideas like ‚ÄúSelf-Isolate and Chill,‚Äù a play on ‚ÄúNetflix and chill,‚Äù a euphemism for sex. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs about two people putting on the same television program at the same time, then calling to talk about it as they watch,‚Äù Krayenhoff says. ‚ÄúI think that has something very exciting or romantic to it.‚ÄùLGBTQ dating service Grindr published a notice to users on its app advising them to follow World Health Organization best practices. ‚ÄúThe health and safety of our users is a top priority for Grindr,‚Äù a spokesperson says. Bumble, a dating app where women make the first move, has also been trying to educate its members. Last week, it published a blog post written by Stanford University epidemiologist Seema Yasmin about how to date during a pandemic. ‚ÄúYour best bet would be to meet in a public place that isn‚Äôt too busy, like a park, and stay three to six feet apart,‚Äù Yasmin wrote. ‚ÄúIf you turn up to find your date coughing and looking unwell, you can advise them to practice good cough hygiene then politely get out of there.‚Äùüì£ The Indian Express is now on Telegram.

I tried the application and here is what I found.Likee, formerly Like Video, is a ‚Äúglobal short video creation platform‚Äù and it looks no different than the other similar platforms‚Äì at least on the first instance. However, I found the interface of the app a bit more simplistic and easier to navigate than its peers, which might not mean much the usual smartphone user but people who aren‚Äôt tech-savvy probably appreciate it.Aside from the infinitely-long video feed, Likee also comes with a Live feature like the BIGO app. This bit is understandable because Likee is owned by Singapore-based BIGO. Just like the BIGO Live, Likee also allows users to send virtual gifts and roses to their favourite creators.I did not witness objectionable content over the live feeds. Also, it feels reassuring to see a parental control feature on Likee that filters content for young users.Likee also comes with a News tab, which looks like a half-baked attempt. All you see here are video clips that don‚Äôt necessarily fall in the news category and the source of these clips are the usual Likee users.I could spot several media outlets on the app that were posting real short video clips for the news of the day. I personally feel that Likee should reach out to more media outlets to fill its News tab‚Äì which, at the moment, looks a bit unrefined.On Likee, there is support for 15 Indian languages, including Tamil, Telugu, Marathi, Gujarati, Urdu and Sanskrit.Talking about the unique features on the app, BIGO Technology‚Äôs Vice President Mike Ong said, ‚ÄúWe also have a unique feature called ‚ÄòSuperme‚Äô, which enables users to create videos using photos in their gallery. It comes with different features and themes such as creative, morph, dramatic, face cut and festival. Another similar significant feature is the ‚ÄòFace Magic Feature‚Äô, which allows users to have fun by morphing a celebrity face in any of their favourite dance/movie scenes with their own face to create engaging videos.‚ÄùExpress Tech is now on¬†Telegram.

People worldwide are constantly checking on news updates to know the status of the virus in their country. Several companies have created dashboards that allow everyone globally to track the number of confirmed and recovered cases, deaths country-wise. All these dashboards are available online.Esri, a Geospatial software & SaaS company, has also created an interactive dashboard to monitor and map global impact of COVID-19 on a real-time basis. The India team of the company has created a similar real-time dashboard to map the spread of COVID 19 cases in India including infectious cases and emerging pattern among population/geographies.¬†The dashboard dedicated to India is being used by National Disaster Management. Click on this link to check the dashboard.‚ÄúESRI India is already assisting many Government organizations like NDMA, NIC & other state departments to provide key information like datasets, software, applications, and other useful information like confirmed cases and recovered cases. This dashboard is becoming an asset for Indian authorities, administrators, health institutions, individual health practitioners and doctors to gauge the extent of the outbreak and work on strategies on a continuous basis to curb the virus,‚Äù Esri said.This Esri dashboard uses GIS (geographic information system) technology to provide real-time coronavirus updates. It shows cases confirmed worldwide which is currently at 343,421, total number of deaths and also the ones that have been recovered. Unlike a lot of other dashboards, this one shows cases confirmed country-wise as well.Currently, the countries with most cases are China, Italy, the US, Spain, Germany, followed by Iran, France, South Korea, Switzerland, the UK and the rest.The Esri dashboard also shows graphical representation on the confirmed and daily increase of cases to provide people with a better idea of what‚Äôs happening around the globe and also in their own country. Esri has collaborated with WHO, CDC, ECDC, NHC, DXY, 1point3acres, Worldometers.info, BNO, state and national government health departments, and local media to update the information on the dashboard.The dashboard also allows everyone to just click the country on the map and get details like confirmed cases, deaths, recovered, and existing cases of the region in just a single click.üì£ The Indian Express is now on Telegram.

https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/social/managing-screen-time-during-work-from-home-apples-screen-time-google-android-digital-well-being-apps-6328020/,These features will help you manage screen time during work from home,2020-03-24 11:01:34+05:30,"The coronavirus pandemic means that many of us are now working from home in India. Most major Indian cities are under lockdown, and work from home has become the norm, but it comes with its own benefits and headaches. While the stress of commuting might have disappeared for sometime, many of us have new worries to deal about when working from home. There‚Äôs the issue of internet connectivity, office VPNs slowing down speeds, along with the distractions of social media and other services.One must also factor in that since there is a lockdown, many of us are constantly scrolling some screen or other, be it the phone or desktop or even the smart TV in the living room. Since we can no longer leave our homes, the screen inevitably becomes the only source of entertainment, and it might be a good time to put some restrictions in place so that you can at least focus on other activities to keep yourself distracted.We look at the tools you can rely on for screen management available on Android and iOS devices, along with other apps that can be useful during this period.Google introduced the ‚ÄòDigital Wellbeing‚Äô feature with Android Pie and it is available on most smartphones now. This is one of the most useful tools to restrict your usage of certain apps, and helps you gain some control if you are too addicted to the phone.The Digital Wellbeing feature can be found in the settings apps on Google Pixel phones, and any other device running Android Pie and above, including popular phones from Samsung, Redmi, Realme, and other brands.You can go to Digital Wellbeing in the Settings app of your smartphone and set up the Dashboard to put a time limit on each of your apps. So if you feel you are spending too much time scrolling on Facebook or Instagram, you can see a timer. Once the timer is set and you exceed the daily limit for the day, Android will then block your access to the app. The lowest limit you can set is 5 minutes, going up all the way to 24 hours.Of course, there is the option of resetting the timer, and regaining access, but one advantage with the dashboard is that you can screen out some of these apps during your work day, so you are not distracted by these during the designated work hours. Once you are done with the day, you can go to Settings and reset the timer to gain some more access should you wish to do so.The good thing with Google‚Äôs Digital Wellbeing feature is that you can individually put a limit on each app. So if you feel you are spending too much time on Netflix or Instagram, you can restrict them individually.Read our others tips regarding work from home and internet connectivityInternet not working properly? How to check the speed and fix it | Boosting your WiFi signal strength |¬† Download these video calling apps if you‚Äôre working from homeAnother feature of Digital Wellbeing which might be useful in these stressful times is the Wind Down. This will implement a Night schedule from a select time period, say 10 pm to 6 am in the morning and ensure your phone does not keep buzzing with notifications. The screen goes to a grayscale, which is easier on the eyes, and Do Not Disturb (DND) mode is turned on automatically during this time.There‚Äôs also a Focus Mode, which will pause distracting apps when you need to focus during a fixed period. So you can set a schedule, say during your work hours and choose apps that should be locked down. During that period, Android will stop access to these apps, the icon will get greyed out till focus mode is on. This can be beneficial if you find games, social media apps distracting during work hours.Apple‚Äôs iOS and MacOS users also have the option of introducing limits on their apps with Screen Time, which was introduced with iOS 12. This will let you choose restrictions for apps based on categories, unlike Android which has options for individual apps.Screen Time lets you set limits for Social networking, Games, Entertainment, Creativity, Productivity apps, and on websites as well. The only problem is that sometimes apps that get tagged in a category might not really be used for that purpose. One example is WhatsApp, which will be tagged under social networking, but many offices might be using it to coordinate. So you might find some apps get locked out, even though you want access to them all day.But there is a solution. In the Always Allowed segment, you can go down and choose Apps for which you do not want any downtime or locking out.Another useful feature is Downtime, which you can customise. During this time, only apps that you choose are allowed and phone calls will be available. You can customise it for days of the week.There is also the option of Communication Limits, which might be particularly useful if you need to set some boundaries for after work hour calls, which can be an issue during work from home. During the downtime, you can ensure that Phone calls, Messages, FaceTime requests are restricted to specific contacts. Screen Time is also available on macOS, though you will have to set it up separately on the MacBook.For those who want to go beyond the standard default options available on the devices, there are apps to offer this kind of control as well. Freedom is one such app, which is available on iOS, Android, MacOS and Windows 10 as well. But it is not free, and you get only seven free sessions. After that the service costs $6.99 per month or $2.42/month if you get it for one year, There‚Äôs also a $129 offer for forever, though right now it is retailing at $64.50 as part of a discount.With Freedom, you can start a session and block all distracting websites and apps on your PC or MacBook while working. You can set the duration for how long these should be blocked, and it will ensure greater focus when you are working from home. You can set the duration for each session and the site will be blocked for that period.App Detox is for those of you who are still on older versions of Android, or find that the Digital Wellbeing feature is not enough to help you. The app will let you choose apps from which you want a detox, and will let you decide from specific daytimes on specific days to number of launches to usage time for a particular app.It will also let you decide if you want to stay away from an app for a number of days. There‚Äôs also the more drastic, ‚ÄòFOREVER‚Äô option, if you decide you don‚Äôt want to use this app again. This is only available on Android.Moment is an app on iOS users for those who need more and Screen Time is just not helping. So when setting up the phone it will ask you what you want to do be it track screen time to stop wasting time to reduce anxiety. There‚Äôs also a Moment Coach to help you use the phone less, though it will cost Rs 689 per month. The app also has courses, though you need to subscribe into order to access these features.Here‚Äôs a quick coronavirus guide for you to stay updated: Who all should be tested for Covid-19 and when? | How should you quarantine yourself? | How often (and how) should you clean your home? | What is the Janata Curfew announced by PM Modi? | Who are restricted from coming to India, and from when? | How long can the virus live on surfaces or in air around you? | Still more Coronavirus Q&A Explained news here

Everyone is staying indoors at least till the time the virus is controlled. And this is not a good sign for online dating apps as the key idea here itself gets lost.

Several online dating platforms are trying their best to help users have a great time, but still maintaining a distance.Bumble, for instance, believes it can provide a ‚Äúgreat outlet for those who may be concerned with meeting people in person‚Äù. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre already seeing reports in the media that a pandemic could trigger loneliness and isolationism, and Bumble is one way to stay connected to real people without having to meet in the physical world,‚Äù pitched the spokesperson for the online dating app. Bumble is promoting features like voice calls and video chat so that people connect on platform without having to share their contact information.Bumble said the usage has remained steady and in trend for this time of year. The platform has seen users begin to mention COVID-19 and Coronavirus more and more in their profiles. ‚ÄúWe‚Äôre experiencing a major lifestyle change at the moment and we‚Äôre focused on helping our users shift the dating app experience to an in-app dating experience,‚Äù the spokesperson said.READ: How food delivery services are coping with coronavirus pandemicPopular dating app Tinder is also trying out ways to engage users.

https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/techook/phones-launch-redmi-realme-vivo-xiaomi-6327783/,Redmi K30 Pro to Realme Narzo 10 series: Here are phones launching in India this week,2020-03-23 14:56:28+05:30,"It‚Äôs only the third month of 2020 and there have been numerous smartphone launches in the country, giving users more choices to select a phone. However, smartphone manufacturers aren‚Äôt done yet. There are more devices lined up to be launched than you would have thought.We are listing down the phones that are launching this week. Also, we‚Äôll be updating this list if and when some manufacturer announces to introduce a new offering.Redmi‚Äôs flagship smartphone Redmi K30 Pro is scheduled to launch on March 24 in China. Earlier, the device was slated to be launched on March 3 but the launch was postponed‚Äî probably due to the coronavirus pandemic.The Redmi K30 Pro has already been confirmed to come with flagship-grade specifications like the Qualcomm Snapdragon 865 processor, 5G support, and a full-screen OLED display. The phone is reported to carry a pop-up selfie camera, 64MP quad-rear camera setup, 4700mAh battery, and 33W fast charging. The Redmi K30 Pro is tipped to be priced between Yuan 3000 (around Rs 30,000) to Yuan 3500 (around Rs 35,000).Realme already launched four phones this year including the Realme 6, 6 Pro, C3, and X50 Pro.

https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/opinion-technology/xiaomi-blog-mi-10-launch-coronavirus-chaos-6327591/,The Xiaomi Blog: A Mi 10 launch in the times of coronavirus chaos,2020-03-23 13:44:19+05:30,"These are unprecedented times. Most of India, in fact, most of the world, is in a lockdown. Essential services are the only ones allowed, and suddenly everyone you know is working from home. So it does seem like an odd time for smartphones to launch, but then as they say the show must go on, even if it is taking place online.For Xiaomi it will be a big one, the Mi 10, its first flagship phone in India since the Mi MIX 2 launched back in 2017. And it comes at a very turbulent time. For one, Xiaomi has already given plenty of indication that the Mi 10 is a premium device with a higher price, likely higher than the China variants, which are starting at Yuan 3999 or roughly Rs 40,000.The messaging has been clear: This is not an affordable flagship and Xiaomi India head Manu Kumar Jain has laid out the exact reasons for this as well. One is the increased GST from 12 per cent to 18 per cent, two being that this is a direct import, meaning unlike other Redmi phones, this is not made in India. Third, is a depreciating rupee, which is bound to make everything worse. This could very well explain Jain‚Äôs tweet today about the rupee at 76.06 followed by the teary-eye emoji.Add to that the impact that the coronavirus lockdown will continue to have on the Indian economy and global economy as a whole, means the Mi 10 is unlikely to have an auspicious launch. And it won‚Äôt be the only phone that faces this.ALSO READ: Mi 10 is coming, but will Xiaomi‚Äôs flagship dreams finally succeed in India?Xiaomi will be hoping that things play out very differently, but there‚Äôs no doubt that even without the existing crisis, breaking into the premium segment has been a challenge for them. I can‚Äôt help but think of previous premium flagships from the company and how they fared in India.The Mi 5 when it launched in 2016 was a reasonably priced flagship at Rs 24,999 and was competing with phones like the OnePlus, given the specifications it offered. But it failed to set the market on fire, unlike the affordable Redmi phones. The Mi MIX 2 in 2017 failed to do any better for the company, despite being a unique and innovative phone with a full-screen display and that too priced under Rs 40,000.Express Tech is now on¬†Telegram. Click¬†here to join our channel (@expresstechnology)¬†and stay updated with the latest tech newsAfter that, it seemed Xiaomi had given up on launching its Mi branded flagships in India. But in 2020, the Mi 10 is supposed to change all of that. On paper, the Mi 10 with its 5G capabilities sounds like an excellent flagship. It has the high-end Snapdragon 865 processor, a 108MP camera, which so far only Samsung‚Äôs Galaxy S20 Ultra is offering, 50W fast-charging, and a premium design. But numbers show that breaking into the premium segment is more than just a specifications game in India.In the ultra-premium, Apple still dominates, and hence the year-old iPhone XR continued to be a best-seller in India in 2019. Then there‚Äôs Samsung and OnePlus, which have segmented their brand positions in this segment of the market. For the Mi 10, the challenge won‚Äôt lie in the device‚Äôs performance or specifications. But rather, in convincing users that this is the premium phone to consider, over say the next OnePlus or the existing Samsung flagships, or even the iPhone 11, which is retailing at discounts.üì£ The Indian Express is now on Telegram.

https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/covid-19-internet-speeds-worldwide-ookla-numbers-6327624/,COVID-19 and internet speeds across the world: What Ookla‚Äôs numbers show,2020-03-23 12:34:10+05:30,"The coronavirus pandemic has come with new constraints for internet connectivity all over the world as more and more people move to a work from home format. With users across the world, including India, now relying on their home broadband lines to carry out work tasks and for their daily entertainment, there‚Äôs bound to be an impact on internet speeds given the strain. We have listed out some tips to make sure you get the most out of your WiFi.Ookla, which is known for its Speedtest app, has now released numbers on the trends they have observed during this outage. Here‚Äôs a look at what the numbers show.India typically does better on the fixed line broadband speeds, and mobile internet speeds are where we continue to lag. According to the February 2020 data from Ookla, when the coronavirus threat was not so severe, India‚Äôs mobile data ranking was 128 with an average download speed of 11.83 Mbps, while upload speeds stood at 4.61 Mbps.In the fixed line broadband department, India was doing slightly better with a ranking of 69, though this does represent a drop of three places. The download speeds stood at 39.65 Mbps, while uploads were at 37.09.So what happened once the coronavirus outbreak took place, especially in the beginning of March? Ookla‚Äôs data shows that fixed broadband download speed increased very slightly between the weeks of March 2 and March 9, just hitting 40Mbps for downloads.But mobile download speed remained flat during this week, so the positive here is they have not fallen too much. However, data for the rest of March is yet to be made available, and it would be interesting to see how the trend plays out, given that most of India which relies on fixed broadband is now working from home.ALSO READ: Five simple tips to boost Wi-Fi signal while working from homeALSO READ: Coronavirus pandemic pushes up internet usage; how to monitor excessive broadband useData from Ookla shows that mobile download speeds in China improved between the weeks of March 2 and March 9, while mobile download speeds in Hubei province during the week of March 9 were relatively flat.The country saw a dip in fixed broadband performance due to the outbreak. China saw decreased download speeds and higher latency, including in the Hubei province, starting the week of January 13, 2020. Ookla notes that while mobile performance is steadily improving in China overall, mobile download speeds in Hubei are still low.Given Italy is the worst hit during the pandemic with the highest death toll right, and with the country under lockdown, it is having an impact on internet speeds as well. In February 2020, Italy‚Äôs average fixed broadband line download speeds stood at 62.70 Mbps.Data shows that the mean download speed on both mobile and fixed broadband have declined between the weeks of March 2 and March 9 in Italy overall, and in the Lombardy region specifically. Again this is the region in Northern Italy which is the worst impacted and under lockdown.Latency has also increased on mobile and fixed broadband in Italy as a whole and on fixed broadband in Lombardy. The data showed decrease in the speeds from the week of February 17, once the outbreak started to grow.The United States is the third worst hit country in the list of those impacted by the pandemic, with cities like New York, San Francisco declaring lockdowns early on. Now, these have been extended to the entire state of California, New York, Connecticut and Illinois.In February 2020, the average fixed broadband speeds in the country stood at 137.34. Data from Ookla shows that San Francisco saw its mean download speed over fixed broadband decrease in the week of March 2 and 9.However, mobile download speeds increased during the same period. Ookla says the speeds for both fixed and mobile broadband are varying within a normal range through the week of March 2 in all areas of the United States, and they will update with more analysis later on.After Italy and the United States, Germany and Spain have seen the highest level of infections. In Germany, mean download speed over fixed broadband decreased slightly between the weeks of March 2 and 9. In Spain this decrease started earlier in the week of February 24 till March 9. France which has over 16,000 cases has also seen download speeds decline in the same week.üì£ The Indian Express is now on Telegram.

Here‚Äôs how to check the internet speed and fix it if slow,2020-03-25 10:16:36+05:30,"The coronavirus pandemic has forced people worldwide to stay indoors and that has increased the dependency on the internet, especially home broadband and Wi-Fi. With everyone sitting at home and using the internet for work, streaming movies and shows, playing games and more there‚Äôs a chance you might see your internet speeds drop significantly compared to the last few weeks given the strain on networks.So what should you do to fix the speed? Giving people can‚Äôt stop using the internet given it is the only means of entertainment right now, we explain what steps you can take should the problem arise.To check the status of the internet speed of your broadband connection you can simply download the SpeedTest application on your Android phone or iPhone. Or you can go to the Speedtest website on your desktop as well. Open the app after it has been installed and click on ‚ÄúGo‚Äù option shown in the middle of the phone screen. The app will take a few seconds to test and show the results of the internet speed of your broadband connection.ALSO READ: Five simple tips to boost Wi-Fi signal while working from homeALSO READ: Coronavirus pandemic pushes up internet usage; how to monitor excessive broadband useWe tested the speed of the broadband connection we are using a couple of times, and mostly the download and upload speeds were at par. However, compared to last week the speed level has dropped significantly. If you‚Äôre using mobile internet you can follow the same procedure to test the data speed. However, we would recommend using a stable broadband connection if working from home given mobile data can finish in a day or two leaving you with no internet connection at all.The easiest and the most common way out is to reboot the router.

Offices are asking their employees to work from home for a period which might be escalated to two or three more weeks. In this scenario, a proper Wi-Fi connection is mandatory to carry out your work duties.You might have invested in a good broadband connection but there may be some problems which could slow down the internet speed. We are listing out ways to boost your Wi-Fi signal while you work remotely from your home.READ: Internet slow? Here‚Äôs how you can check your internet speed¬†If you are receiving signal only when you are standing right next to your router, you need to change its location. The placement of the router can affect wireless coverage. For better signal strength, place the router in the centre of the house, away from walls. Do not place inside a cabinet or assign it to the far end of your home. Also, make sure there are no electronics near the router.If you have a dual-band router, make sure to configure it for optimum performance, which might be the 5GHz band instead of the more common 2.4GHz band. The higher band offers faster speeds and encounters less interference from other wireless networks and devices. However, the 5GHz band doesn‚Äôt handle obstructions and also doesn‚Äôt reach as far as a 2.4GHz signal. So, choose the frequency of your router as per your need.Also read | How billionaires are helping in the fight against coronavirusIf you live in densely populated regions, signals from other wireless networks or other electronic devices may end up congesting the channel your router uses to connect to your devices. Set your router to Automatic selection mode so that your router can select the least congested channel for you. However, in case your router doesn‚Äôt have Auto channel selection option, you can manually select channel that works best for you.READ: These features will help you manage screen time during work from homeMost modern routers these days come with Quality of Service or QoS tool that lets you set priority for different kind of tasks.

It announced plans to hire 100,000 workers to meet demand and is temporarily boosting pay among its warehouse employees and instructed its contract delivery partners to also raise wages for drivers who don‚Äôt work directly for Amazon. Key rival Walmart Inc. is also hiring workers and doling out bonuses to staff helping it meet demand.Both companies face criticism from lawmakers, workers and activists for not doing enough to protect hourly workers on the front lines of the crisis. The pressure ramped up Friday when a group of workers from Walmart, Amazon and other big retailers, called United for Respect, demanded paid leave for those affected by the coronavirus outbreak and better protective measures from their employers.Amazon on Saturday announced hourly workers in its US delivery network would receive double pay for every hour they work in excess of 40 each week, effective March 15 through May 9. That follows temporary raises of $2 per hour that will be in effect through April.Coronavirus pandemic: How the delivery ecosystem is coping up with new challengeMonica Moody, a 22-year-old Amazon warehouse worker near Charlotte, North Carolina, said she and her fellow employees don‚Äôt have adequate protective gear or sufficient time to wash their hands during their shifts. She argued that the warehouse should close temporarily to be sanitized.Also on Friday, four Democratic senators, led by Cory Booker of New Jersey, wrote to Bezos asking that the company implement more aggressive safety measures and offer more hazard pay to its employees. The letter cited news reports in the past week in which workers at the front lines of Amazon‚Äôs logistics network raised concerns they didn‚Äôt have the time or resources to protect themselves as they helped speed packages to customer doorsteps. The Amazon delivery drivers in California told Bloomberg they received one single disinfecting wipe to clean vans before the start of their shifts.Bezos said the company has increased cleaning in its facilities and implemented instructions for employees to maintain a safe distance from one another, and continues to meet daily to address safety issues. Getting proper equipment remains a challenge, he said. On Wednesday, Amazon reported the first confirmed case among its U.S. warehouse workforce ‚Äî at a delivery station near New York‚Äôs LaGuardia Airport.Coronavirus pandemic: Ola Share, Uber Pool services suspended temporarily‚ÄúWe‚Äôve placed purchase orders for millions of face masks we want to give to our employees and contractors who cannot work from home, but very few of those orders have been filled,‚Äù Bezos said.‚ÄúMasks remain in short supply globally and are at this point being directed by governments to the highest-need facilities like hospitals and clinics,‚Äù he added. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs easy to understand why the incredible medical providers serving our communities need to be first in line.

https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/opinion-technology/the-apple-blog-why-ipad-pro-has-me-excited-6326312/,The Apple Blog: Why the new iPad Pro has me all excited,2020-03-22 11:31:35+05:30,"For all the gadgets I have used and tested, I don‚Äôt get much excited when I hear of a new product or launch. But there are exceptions and one such exception was this week with Apple‚Äôs announcement of the new iPad Pro. And there is a good reason why it got me rubbing my hands in anticipation.Over the past couple of years, thanks to a mixture of reasons ‚Äî a lot of travel for work and a bad back that does not keep up to the pressures ‚Äî I have moved to the iPad as my primary computer when on the move. Yes, at home I use my MacBook Air and at work I have a Windows PC, but at work outside Delhi, in an airport, in a plane and in a hotel room, I‚Äôm always using the iPad Pro.Why I‚Äôm stuck with the iPhoneAnd I can do everything on the iPad, as I have been for close to a decade now, from writing articles, to editing and even filing copies on WordPress. But there is at least one thing that I don‚Äôt enjoy doing on an iPad and that is working on a spreadsheet.And this is the primary reason why the new iPad Pro with its TrackPad support with the latest version of iPadOS.Let me elaborate. Every week there are a few things I have to do on spreadsheets, updating reports, creating snapshots and the like. And often I am on the road when these need to be done. And over time I have realised that there are things that are really tough to do just using touch. Selecting a particular cell, for instance, can get irritating, also copying a certain part of a large sheet. And I have gradually started avoiding this on the iPad.However, with the new iPad Pro, you have the new Magic Keyboard with its trackpad and you can pretty much do everything you do on a proper laptop. You can move the cursor exactly where you want, using the trackpad and not the screen. And you can select more precisely now. Finger-licking good for iPad users like me.Also, with the new iPadOS Apple is rethinking the cursor itself. Why does the cursor have to be a vertical line, especially in a touch environment? So the Apple cursor will be a round, ‚Äújust like your fingertips‚Äù. Even how this cursor will interact with buttons and elements on screen is being rethought. All very exciting for an iPad user.Can you guess which are the top-selling smartphones in the world?Also, I have been noticing how Apple is moving its iPad more towards the laptop experience in recent times, even as its MacBooks tend to add more mobile experiences. In fact, with an iPad Pro this good and effective, I am surprised Cupertino is still investing in the MacBook Air. If the functionality is the same ‚Äî maybe the iPad Pro has more power now ‚Äî why not just move all to the iPad form factor.The MacBook Air now costs Rs 92,900 onwards and the iPad Pro base model with the not-so-cheap Magic Keyboard totals just under Rs 1,00,000. I would rather opt for the latter, after all this is 2020.

https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/techook/as-coronavirus-pandemic-pushes-up-home-internet-usage-heres-a-guide-to-monitor-excessive-broadband-use-6325556/,How to monitor excessive broadband use while working from home,2020-03-24 12:11:34+05:30,"As more families choose to stay home and avoid stepping out because of the coronavirus outbreak, the usage of internet data has seen a dramatic increase. With millions of people working from home and family members spending more time streaming TV shows and movies, doing live video chats and watching live news, a new situation of internet overload has emerged.In fact, the European Union has asked Amazon, Netflix and YouTube to switch to SD streaming during peak hours. Although the move is temporary, it‚Äôs a reminder that internet networks are overloaded and there might be a situation when home broadband speeds dwindle further due to surge in demand. Industry experts are warning people to monitor their broadband usage to prevent internet overload as no one knows when the coronavirus pandemic will subside.Here are some easy to do tips to keep your broadband usage in check.Before anything else, you need to know how fast your internet is. A speed test will verify that your ISP is able to deliver the speed that is promised. You never know the service provider is charging more for the plan which you have opted for. If that‚Äôs the case, then you should call your ISP and ask to fix your internet speed. The best way to do so is by visiting Ookla‚Äôs Speedtest.net.Here‚Äôs how to check your home broadband speed*Connect your computer to Wi-Fi or use a router using an ethernet cable.*Open any browser, be it Chrome or Firefox.*Navigate to Speedtest.netThe benefit of Speedtest.net is that it will show your download and upload speed. This is the easiest way to measure your internet speed. Keep in mind that internet speeds fluctuate many times a day, so it‚Äôs advisable to do multiple tests in order to find your connection speed.READ: How to check internet speed and fix it if slowBut it‚Äôs not enough to check your broadband speed alone. These days people spend more time on their phones and binge on Netflix, watch YouTube videos or stream music through apps. So it is important to test how much internet speed you get on a phone. Ookla offers the Speedtest app for iPhone and Android.Now that you know how fast or slow your internet connection speed is, you can easily decide on whether you want to continue with the existing ISP or switch to another ISP.Do not jump the gun and decide to change your ISP immediately. If you found out that you are not getting the speed promised by your ISP, call the customer care number and try to fix the issue. If your ISP can‚Äôt solve the issue, check out other ISPs in your area and compare plans, what is the monthly data cap before you sign it, promised upload and download internet speeds and customer service. Estimate a rough internet bill in your mind, before finalising your next internet provider.Whether you are planning to switch to a new internet provider or continuing with an existing ISP, keep track on how much internet speed and data you need now and in the near future. This will help you monitor your usage of internet and broadband consumption at home. There are three ways to do it. The simple way is to compare the old and current bill. It can be done by logging into the internet service provider‚Äôs website.5 tips to boost Wi-Fi signal during working from homeAnother way is to figure out how fast your internet speed is currently and monthly data consumptionon. You cannot deny the fact our broadband usage and reliance on the internet has increased. And on top of it, we use multiple connected devices at our homes, including our smartphones which are always connected to Wi-Fi. The point to remember here is that one connection is shared with all the devices to your network. The more devices you own, the more speed you will need.The decision to increase the internet speed or to opt for a broadband plan with extra data also depends on how you and your family consume the internet. In a household, where the entire family binge-watches Netflix and where kids own PlayStation or multiple laptops and mobile devices, we are looking at the activities that require more data, thus requiring a faster internet to support streaming and gaming. And if we consider a household with two family members that casually browse the internet but are more into social media, we are looking at the entire set of activities. They might not need a Giga speed internet connection or a plan with unlimited data. For them, even a broadband plan with 20Mbps speed and 100GB a month would be sufficient.Download movies in SD instead than HD: If you stream or download movies from platforms Netflix or Amazon Prime Video on smartphones, you can save some data by choosing SD over HD. You probably won‚Äôt notice the difference when watching a movie in SD over HD on a smaller screen. Netflix has, in fact, offers the Rs 199 mobile-only that gives you access to all the content at SD instead of the standard HD resolution.Stop videos from automatically playing on Facebook: The Facebook app consumes a lot of mobile data in the background, thanks to those autoplaying videos, but you can stop them from playing.*Open your Facebook app.*Tap the three stacked lines at the bottom of the screen.*Select ‚ÄúSettings & Privacy‚Äù followed by ‚ÄúSettings.‚Äù*Scroll down and tap ‚ÄúMedia and Contacts.‚Äù*Select ‚ÄúAutoplay.‚Äù*Choose ‚ÄúNever Auto-play Videos.‚ÄùUse Wi-Fi when possible: Turn off Wi-Fi when you are not using them. You can check whether your laptop, iPad or smartphone is not using Wi-Fi by looking for the Wi-Fi symbol that is characterised by three curved lines at the top of your phone screen. If you do not see that symbol, you can go to the phone‚Äôs settings for what Wi-Fi networks are available nearby. Similarly, switch off cellular data on smartphones when you are at home and instead log in to a stable Wi-Fi connection.üì£ The Indian Express is now on Telegram.

Some are doing their best to keep things interesting while telecommuting.Snapchat parent Snap Inc has seen a 10-fold surge in downloads since the beginning of the month of a tool that makes calls on services like Zoom Video Communications Inc and Google Hangouts a bit more lighthearted. The feature, called Snap Camera, allows people to overlay their faces with an augmented-reality filter, turning them into a talking toilet-paper roll or slice of pizza, or evening out skin tone for those who would prefer not to apply makeup while working at home.The service includes thousands of filter options and so-called lenses, some created by artists and others by Santa Monica, California-based Snap. When it launched in October 2018, the mobile-app maker thought the lenses would likely be most popular among gamers who were broadcasting their conquests on Twitch, the video-streaming app owned by Amazon.com Inc. Now, Snap Camera could help the company expand beyond its dedicated teenage fan base, and into the corporate crowd.The spike in downloads gives some indication of how popular video-chat services are becoming, as more state and local governments advise citizens to shelter in place to avoid contracting Covid-19. People are turning to corporate chat services not just for work meetings, but to have virtual happy hours with friends, or connect with family members when an in-person meeting would be too risky.Social-media giant Facebook Inc said this week that in Italy, it has seen more than twice as much video-chatting activity on WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger as it did a year earlier. Facebook expects similar trends around the world, as more countries go into lockdown. The surge has led to concern that the added activity could stress companies‚Äô servers, causing interruptions in service.üì£ The Indian Express is now on Telegram.

https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-reviews/samsung-galaxy-z-flip-review-6323854/,Samsung Galaxy Z Flip review: Bend it like Z Flip,2020-03-21 18:04:01+05:30,"Smartphone innovation has reached the point where it had become hard to impress existing users and get new ones with what is on offer. This is why smartphone companies have been picking their brains on what they can come up with next to shock and awe the user. Since they have been successful in solving most of the pain points of users from battery life to camera quality, the next frontier seems to be form factor itself. This is why there has been a range of attempts ‚Äî successful and otherwise ‚Äî to make the phone smaller or more portable. This is also where the need arises to make a phone foldable. Mind you, this is not really solving a user problem. It is more like saying ‚Äòwhy don‚Äôt you try what we have come up with‚Äô.The Samsung Galaxy Fold was in many ways the first attempt to make a phone fold. However, the unfolded Fold was more of a tablet than a phone and the folded Fold was more the phone we were used to in the past. Confusing, right? Well, that could well be the idea. The next attempt has been from Motorola which is trying to review its iconic Moto Razr with a 2019 version that has a screen that can fold. This is more a recreating of an old bottle with new wine in it. Samsung, having had its hits and misses with the Fold, wants to popularise the foldable concept with its Galaxy Z Flip, which is a very different take from the Razr despite all the similarities.Samsung Galaxy Z Flip specifications: 6.7-inch main display/1.1-inch secondary screen | Snapdragon 855+ processor, 8GB RAM, 256GB storage non-expandable | Android 10 | 3300mAh battery | Dual camera (12MP+10MP)Samsung Galaxy Z Flip price in India: Rs. 109,999Well, with the Galaxy Z Flip you don‚Äôt have to go hunting for what‚Äôs new. Yes, it is the folding form factor. Now, Samsung has thought of this fold in a very different way. It wanted to offer a relatively large display phone for users and used the fold to hide away the awkwardness of the 6.7-inch screen. So you fold it into half and hide it in your shirt or jeans pocket. But then what happens when you fold a 6.7-inch phone? Well, it ends up like a small box, not much smaller than the pricey cigarette cases of the past, just more thicker.But Samsung has done it well. One, the folded Z Flip is as portable as a phone can ever be, though you still feel it in your pocket thanks to the 183-gram weight. Two, though a folding phone, there is no learning involved on how to use it. It is just a phone that folds at the end of the day and does not present new challenges when it comes to the user interface. But it also presents new opportunities.Generally, it is believed that making a foldable screen for a smartphone is easier ‚Äî it just needs two modes: open and shut. But Samsung has pushed itself to offers the screen at all angles in between the two. So you can just keep the phone open at a 90-degree angle and watch YouTube as you also read the comments below. There could be more use cases, but these will evolve over time.Also, the phone is stylish almost veering towards the sexy with its metallic mirror kind of finish. If the finish itself was not bling enough for you, Samsung also has a gold version of the phone. The design is practical and functional, especially the fingerprint scanner on the side which reminded me of some Sony Xperia phones of the past.Like Moses splitting water, Samsung has done the inconceivable by making glass bend for the Z Flip, though with some help from German manufacturer Schott. And it is the hinge that is behind the magic of any foldable device, another element that Samsung has nailed. While it is great that Samsung has managed a second foldable device, what is commendable is that this looks like a phone that can take all the heavy bending.So here is a phone that offers the latest form factor. That itself makes you stand out in a crowd where literally every other phone can‚Äôt fold or even bend. That‚Äôs why you buy this phone to make heads turn and let the world know you have some serious moolah as well as good taste.There is also the sheer convenience factor as I mentioned before. We have all used phones that would easily slip into our pant pockets. Now, we have to factor in the phone when you are doing something. Your mind is constantly processing the question: where do I keep it? And you are always trying new places. At times the shirt pocket is too small, or the phone is too heavy for your loose, airy pants. The Galaxy Z Flip can potentially take away a lot of that tension from your life.Then the Z Flip is a great phone, with or without the fold. This is like any Samsung flagship device and can do everything you expect it to. From top-notch processing power which lets you multitask and push the phone to even edit videos in a jiffy to battery life that lasts more than a day, the Flip has everything. Interestingly, the battery life is better also because the screen is more often than not out of use as you have shut the phone off and only the tiny screen on from is working. Also, the phone has a very good rear camera set up that clicks rich and vivid photos and videos. All you need are taken care of by this phone, which also has the ability to fold into half.The first thing you need to keep in mind is that you can‚Äôt really operate this phone with a single hand. While you might manage folding it with one, it will be tough opening it the same way. This is, after all, large phone and that footprint does impact the phone even when it is folded. The folded phone is a bit clunky, though still very portable. And you have to keep in mind that this will be quite a handful.The selfie camera of the phone gives some unnaturally smooth images that made me look like I had a shave, when I hadn‚Äôt. You might need to tone that down a bit to look natural.This is yet another phone you buy to flaunt. So, yes, that is one reason to buy this phone: to show that you can afford a phone that costs over a lakh and has the first foldable glass in the world. So I would call this an upper management, business class type phone. Yes, some of the fashion-conscious users can also take a look at the Flip because, as I said before, this is one sexy phone. So the phone appeals to all those who made a beeline to buy the Galaxy Fold a few months back.But if you just want a phone that ticks all boxes and also has one trick up its sleeve, the Galaxy Z Flip unfolds itself seeking your attention. This is for me a no-nonsense phone that just works. This is one of the best Android devices you can own at the moment.Disclaimer: The review is based on three days of usage and has some aspects that have not been explored in detail.

Of these, three systems would be installed within a month.Once deployed, the total number of supercomputers under Rs 4,500 crore-National Supercomputing Mission (NSM) would grow to 17.NSM is jointly led by DST and Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY). Commissioned in May 2015, the nodal agencies spearheading the mission are Centre for Development of Advanced Computing (C-DAC), Pune, and Indian Institute of Sciences (IISc),Bengaluru. The NSM envisaged setting up a network of 70 high-performance computing facilities across academia and research institutes, by 2022.Since the mission was approved until September 2019, only three systems ‚Äî PARAM Shivay, PARAM Shakti and PARAM Bhrahma were deployed at IIT-BHU, IIT-Kharagpur and Indian Institute of Science, Education and Research (IISER),Pune, respectively.‚Äù They are equipped with applications from domains like Weather and Climate, Computational Fluid Dynamics, Bioinformatics, and Material science,‚Äù the DST stated.In a report by The Indian Express report published on March 12, it was menioned that both the funding agencies had collectively released a sum to the tune of Rs 750.97 crore towards NSM, between May 2015 and September 2019.
Three systems, that are still gearing up for installation, were originally to be deployed before March 2020. But DST has now deferred the deployment by a month and it is expected to be completed prior to April 2020. These supercomputers will be made operational at IIT-Kanpur, Jawaharlal Nehru Centre for Advanced Scientific Research, Bengaluru, and IIT-Hyderabad, DST said.The major boost to the computing facility, is however, likely to be achieved towards the the end of 2020, when 11 new supercomputing systems will be made operational. Of these, eight systems, with collectively compute power of 16 PetaFlop, will be deployed at institutions located in India‚Äôs Northeastern region.Three of the new systems, each having a compute power of 3PetaFlop, will be commissioned at IIT-Mumbai, IIT-Chennai and Inter University Accelatator Centre, Delhi. ‚ÄúThese systems will form the backbone of the National Knowledge Network,‚Äù DST mentioned.C-DAC‚Äôs Pune and Bengaluru centres are set to further enhance their computing capacities, by adding a 20 Petaflop system and a 100 PetaFlop Artificial Intelligence supercomputing system, each. Additionally, C-DAC will also have a 650 TeraFlop system, solely dedicated towards country‚Äôs StartUp and businesses under Medium and Small Scale Industries (MSMEs).üì£ The Indian Express is now on Telegram.

https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/coronavirus-outbreak-nvidia-opens-its-genome-sequence-software-to-researchers-6324021/,Coronavirus outbreak: NVIDIA opens its genome-sequence software to researchers,2020-03-20 17:19:51+05:30,"NVIDIA is opening up access to its¬†Parabricks genome-sequencing software to researchers working on the coronavirus for free of cost. The tool will be accessible to all researchers who are sequencing the COVID-19 genomes and the genomes of those suffering from COVID-19, according to a press statement from the company.NVIDIA says that¬†Parabricks can slash the time for variant calling on an entire human genome from two days to just one hour on a single server, giving researchers a powerful tool with which to help better understand the virus. The company will give a free 90-day license to Parabricks to any researcher in the world.The tool uses the company‚Äôs graphics processing units (GPUs) to accelerate the analysis of sequence data by fifty times, according to the company. Researchers who want access and have an NVIDIA GPU can fill up the form and get the license. NVIDIA says they will extend the offer as needed and are monitoring how the pandemic evolves.For scientists who are trying to find a cure to the coronavirus, which has globally infected close to 200,000 people, understanding the genome sequence of the virus is crucial, but in most cases it is a long and time-consuming effort. With tools like the Parabricks, it can help save on time, which is a critical factor right now considering that the pandemic shows no signs of stopping.The reason genome sequencing becomes important in viruses, is because many of these undergo genetic changes, and by tracking genetic changes it is possible to know which vaccines will work, whether there have been mutations, and which treatment will be most effective. For instance, the US Centres for Disease Control (CDC) website notes that the influenza viruses are constantly evolving and tracking their genetic code can help keep a better track.With new COVID-19 this is a new strain, and believed to part of the family of coronaviruses, which cause common cold, the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV). But the COVID-2019 strain is one that has not be previously studied and thus genome tracking can give a clearer picture around this virus.Earlier it was reported that the IBM‚Äôs Summit, which is the world‚Äôs most powerful supercomputer, was also used to help run simulations to understand which chemical compounds would work best against the virus.üì£ The Indian Express is now on Telegram.

The researchers from the University of Massachusetts Amherst. In the US said the device called FluSense is envisioned for use in hospitals, healthcare waiting rooms and larger public spaces.The cutting edge-computing platform may expand the arsenal of health surveillance tools used to forecast seasonal flu and other viral respiratory outbreaks, such as the COVID-19 pandemic or SARS, they said. The researchers noted that models like these can be lifesavers by directly informing the public health response during a flu epidemic.These data sources can help determine the timing for flu vaccine campaigns, potential travel restrictions, the allocation of medical supplies and more, they explained.‚ÄúThis may allow us to predict flu trends in a much more accurate manner,‚Äù said Tauhidur Rahman, co-author of the study published in the journal Proceedings of the ACM on Interactive, Mobile, Wearable and Ubiquitous Technologies. The FluSense platform processes a low-cost microphone array and thermal imaging data with a Raspberry Pi and neural computing engine.It stores no personally identifiable information, such as speech data or distinguishing images, noted PhD student and study lead author Forsad Al Hossain. The researchers first developed a lab-based cough model. They then trained the algorithm to create thermal images representing people, and then to count them.‚ÄúOur main goal was to build predictive models at the population level, not the individual level,‚Äù Rahman said. The researchers placed the FluSense devices, encased in a rectangular box about the size of a large dictionary, in four healthcare waiting rooms.From December 2018 to July 2019, the FluSense platform collected and analysed more than 350,000 thermal images and 21 million non-speech audio samples from the public waiting areas. The researchers found that FluSense was able to accurately predict daily illness rates at the university clinic.Multiple and complementary sets of FluSense signals ‚Äústrongly correlated‚Äù with laboratory-based testing for flu-like illnesses and influenza itself, according to the researchers. ‚ÄúThe early symptom-related information captured by FluSense could provide valuable additional and complementary information to current influenza prediction efforts,‚Äù the researchers noted.‚ÄúI thought if we could capture coughing or sneezing sounds from public spaces where a lot of people naturally congregate, we could utilise this information as a new source of data for predicting epidemiologic trends,‚Äù Rahman added.Here‚Äôs a quick coronavirus guide for you to stay updated: Who all should be tested for Covid-19 and when? | How should you quarantine yourself? | How often (and how) should you clean your home? | What is the Janata Curfew announced by PM Modi? | Who are restricted from coming to India, and from when? | How long can the virus live on surfaces or in air around you? | Still more Coronavirus Q&A Explained news hereüì£ The Indian Express is now on Telegram.

But BCCI has delayed IPL 2020 till mid-April in view of the outbreak.The Hotstar app was supposed to get rebranded as Disney+ Hotstar, and in fact, last week the service had gone live for some as part of a beta-testing exercise. The Disney+ branding and content was made available on the app for many users. But it has been pulled since then, though some users will find that they can still access the Disney+ content.‚ÄúWe recently announced that Disney+ would launch in India through the Hotstar service in conjunction with beginning of the Indian Premier League cricket season.

Any Disney+ originals released after this date cannot be viewed.We are still able to access some of the Disney+ shows, including on an LG smart TV for the Hotstar app. But searching for Disney+ content on some other phones does not show any results. It is safe to presume that most users will have to wait till the official rollout takes place for Disney‚Äôs streaming service.üì£ The Indian Express is now on Telegram.

Players like Google, Facebook, Instagram, YouTube and Twitter and others are working to highlight official resources around the outbreak. We take a look at what each player is doing to make sure that users get the right information regarding COVID-19Currently Google is running the ‚ÄòDO THE FIVE‚Äô campaign on its homepage. The campaign will list out the tips to help stop coronavirus spread. The recommendations are:
1 HANDS: Wash them often
2 ELBOW: Cough into it
3 FACE: Don‚Äôt touch it
4 SPACE: Keep safe distance
5 FEEL sick?: Stay homeClicking on it takes you to search page with Coronavirus tips, and notes that this is a Public Service Announcement. The Indian Ministry of Health and Family Welfare logo can also be seen on one side. The top links are from WHO, CDC, etc below the news box, and Google is showcasing official resources.Google‚Äôs YouTube is also highlighting the official sources around the coronavirus.If open the website, there is popup from YouTube, which shows an alert directing users to the WHO website or the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare (MoHFW). In fact searching for coronavirus in YouTube, the first result is actually a ticker linking to the MoHFW website for more information. And each video has the same ticker displaying below it prominently.Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp have all announced measures around the coronavirus awareness campaign. For starters, Facebook has announced a Coronavirus (COVID-19) Information Center, which will be featured at the top of News Feed. This will be a central hub to provide information to the latest news along with resources and tips to stay healthy.Facebook is rolling out the information centre in Italy, France, Germany, Spain, the UK and the US first, and will expand it to more countries in the coming days. The centre will also come with real-time updates from national health authorities and global organisations such as the WHO along with articles, videos, and posts on social distancing and preventing the spread of COVID-19.In the News Feed, Facebook will start giving updates from health authorities as well. There is an alert around the coronavirus, which takes people to the website link. In the US, people will see features to help them connect with local groups and ask for or offer help within their community.On Instagram too, the app will show a call-to-action message right on top which again alerts about COVID-19 and includes a link to the WHO website. If you search for the #coronavirus tag on Instagram, a notification pops up which says ‚ÄòLooking for coronavirus info‚Äô followed by a link to the WHO website or the option to go to posts around the topic. Like its parent company, Instagram too is directing users to the WHO website for authentic and update to resources on the topic.Read more on Coronavirus¬†Explained: As world battles coronavirus pandemic, a few takeaways emergeMumbai lockdown required, CM taking steps in that direction: Saamana on COVID-19Economy infected: Task force has a prescription, concerns mount over delayExplained: Why coronavirus pandemic could kill off many airlinesWhatsApp has announced a dedicated coronavirus information hub, which is available at ‚Äúwhatsapp.com/coronavirus‚Äù and this again directs users to official sources such as WHO.

With the spread of the coronavirus, however, NASA is now shutting down work at the Michoud Assembly Facility in New Orleans, where the rocket is being built, and the Stennis Space Center in Mississippi, about 45 miles to the northeast of Michoud. The first Space Launch System booster is being tested at Stennis.There has been one confirmed case of the coronavirus among Stennis employees. There are no confirmed cases at Michoud, but the number of infected people in the New Orleans area has risen quickly in the past few days.The directive from Bridenstine is for workers at the two NASA sites to work remotely, but there is no way to build or test a rocket without people at the sites. The change takes effect Friday.‚ÄúThe NASA and contractors teams will complete an orderly shutdown that puts all hardware in a safe condition until work can resume,‚Äù Bridenstine said in a news release. A minimal team will remain after the shutdown, only for security and to maintain critical infrastructure.Development of the Space Launch System ‚Äî a modern equivalent of the powerful Saturn 5 that took the Apollo astronauts to the moon ‚Äî has been delayed for years, and the price tag has risen by billions of dollars. The first launch, a test flight without any astronauts aboard, was already not scheduled to occur before 2021. Now even that target may be too optimistic if work at Michoud and Stennis is suspended for an extended period.‚ÄúWe realize there will be impacts to NASA missions,‚Äù Bridenstine said, ‚Äúbut as our teams work to analyze the full picture and reduce risks we understand that our top priority is the health and safety of the NASA workforce.‚ÄùAlso read | Coronavirus outbreak sees WhatsApp calling spike, and this could be a problem for FacebookThere have also been confirmed coronavirus cases at two other NASA centers: the Ames Research Center in California and the Marshall Space Flight Center in Alabama. NASA has been encouraging employees to work from home if possible.The spread of the coronavirus could also jeopardize the launch of the Perseverance rover, which is to head to Mars this summer. That spacecraft is at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida, which has not yet been shut down.Because of the orbital paths of Mars and Earth, the launch must occur in a window in July or August, or it would have to be delayed until 2022 when the two planets again line up.Another Mars mission, ExoMars, a collaboration between Russia and the European Space Agency, has already been pushed back to 2022 from 2020, mostly because of technical problems that cannot be solved by July. Officials also acknowledged that the travel restrictions because of the coronavirus pandemic would have made the work even more challenging to complete.More optimistically, NASA announced Wednesday that it was aiming to launch astronauts to the International Space Station before the end of May.Two astronauts would fly aboard Crew Dragon, a capsule built by SpaceX, the rocket company founded by Elon Musk, and would be the first crewed mission to lift off from the United States since the space shuttles were retired in 2011. Since then, NASA has been relying on Russia to provide transportation for its astronauts.üì£ The Indian Express is now on Telegram.

https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/opinion-technology/the-oppo-blog-why-youtube-is-endorsing-the-find-x2-pro-6323431/,The Oppo blog: Why YouTube is endorsing the Find X2 Pro,2020-03-20 11:09:37+05:30,"When Oppo introduced its Find X2 Pro earlier this month, it made a lot of claims about the display. Now, the phone has got YouTube‚Äôs stamp of approval as a ‚ÄòSignature Device,‚Äô and managed to score a very high rating of A+ according to DisplayMate‚Äôs testing.What‚Äôs a ‚ÄòSignature Device‚Äô you might ask? Well it is YouTube‚Äôs way of certifying a device ensures the best-viewing experience. The Signature Device tag means High Dynamic Range (HDR) videos, support for 360-degree immersive videos and fast video load times.According to YouTube, in order to qualify, the phone needs to support ‚ÄúHDR, high frame rate, reliable DRM (Digital Rights Management) performance, 4K decoding, and use next generation video codecs‚Äù.Right now, the Oppo Find X2 Pro sits on top of the list of these YouTube Signature Devices. More importantly, Oppo Find X2‚Äôs display has also got an A+ approval rating from DisplayMate, known for running scientific and objective tests around phone screens.Read our previous Oppo blog here | the one before that here | and another one hereDisplayMate has gone on to call the Find X2 as a display that comes close to ‚Äútextbook perfect calibration accuracy and performance‚Äù. Typically we have seen only the Samsung or Apple phones score so highly in these tests. The Oppo phone also has the highest peak brightness of 1300 nits, with lowest reflection rates. For perspective, the Samsung Galaxy S20 Ultra had 1342 nits brightness in DisplayMate‚Äôs tests. So it appears Oppo has knocked it out of the park on the display side.Express Tech is now on Telegram. Click here to join our channel (@expresstechie) and stay updated with the latest tech newsAll of this makes the Oppo Find X2 Pro sound like a seriously impressive flagship. But for India users the question will be: When is Oppo Find X2 coming to India? It looks like the wait could be slightly longer as India will be in the second wave of countries where this flagship gets launched, according to a GSMArena report. Given the specifications and features the company is touting, the price will likely be on the higher side. The original Find X launched in India at a price of Rs 59,990, which made it a competitor for the flagship Samsung, Apple phones. Now with the GST on mobiles being higher at 18 per cent compared to the earlier 12 per cent, we can expect the price to be higher.The question is will the Oppo Find X2 Pro with a higher price tag be able to take on Samsung, Apple, OnePlus and even the upcoming Mi 10 Pro in India. The company actually did well in the premium segment with its Reno 2 series last year, but ultra-premium is where Apple and Samsung dominate. We will have to wait see till the Find X2 series makes its way to India.üì£ The Indian Express is now on Telegram.

According to Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, they are seeing very high levels of calling via WhatsApp in countries which are facing the crisis.‚ÄúIn terms of stats, we‚Äôre seeing very elevated levels of use in Italy and in all countries that have been affected. Calling, right ‚Äî so in terms of WhatsApp or Messenger for calling is more than double overall what it normally is,‚Äù he pointed out in a call with the press.Typically, WhatsApp calling spikes around New Year‚Äôs Eve, according to Zuckerberg, which makes sense given this is the time everyone wants to call their friends and family. For instance this year, WhatsApp revealed that there were 100 billion messages exchanged on New Year‚Äôs Eve, and India had 20 billion of these alone, which was a new record of sorts.In the call, Zuckerberg also talked about how psychiatrists and doctors in Lombardy were using WhatsApp calling to reach out to people and ‚Äúhelp them cope with the stress and anxiety of the quarantines.‚Äù¬† But with COVID-19, there is a spike in traffic for both WhatsApp calling and Messenger calling, and while this might sound like good news for Facebook, it is actually not and comes with some worries.Express Tech is now on Telegram.

But Zuckerberg has a point that as more and more countries come under the impact, there could be a major spike in the usage of its services. Especially in India, where the number of cases is still limited to 167,¬† if the cases were to rise, one could see the WhatsApp usage go up further, which will put a strain on the company‚Äôs servers. The company has close to 400 million users in the market.One obvious advantage of WhatsApp calling is that it is free, which makes it the preferred mode of calling for many in the country. and even in other impacted countries. Coronavirus cases are also rising in countries across the world and more people will likely end up relying on the free WhatsApp or other app-based calling services. In Spain and Iran there are more than 18,000 cases, Germany has 15,000+, the United States has more than 14,000 cases, France has more than 10,000 cases and the United Kingdom has close to 3,200 cases.

https://indianexpress.com/article/technology/tech-news-technology/what-is-lidar-and-why-is-it-in-apples-new-ipad-pro-2020-6323223/,What is iPad Pro‚Äôs LiDAR tech and how does it work?,2020-03-21 17:59:52+05:30,"When Apple launched a new iPad Pro on Wednesday, there was one particular feature that drew everyone‚Äôs interest along with the keyboard which now has a proper trackpad and the dual-camera system. This is also the first Apple device to feature a LiDAR scanner.But what is LiDAR, and why has Apple used this sensor on the new iPad?In simple terms, LiDAR stands for light detection and ranging. It is basically a remote sensing method that uses light in the form of a pulsed laser to measure distances to the subject. These light pulses ‚Äì when combined with other data, generate accurate, high-resolution three-dimensional information of the object.Like LiDAR, Sonar and Radar too can reveal information about an object‚Äôs shape, size, direction and height, but they are different in the type of signal they use.Sonar (short for sound navigation and ranging) relies on sound waves to detect objects and hence is usually used to detect objects underwater. Meanwhile, Radar (short for radio detection and ranging) uses radio waves to determine an object‚Äôs distance or range. Radio waves can work over a long distance and perform better in dusty conditions.LiDAR is typically used to collect high-density data in order to produce high-resolution maps. LiDAR sensors are being fitted under drones to create readings of the terrain, transmission lines, buildings, and trees. Experts say LiDAR accurately maps the ground beneath and can provide a highly accurate 3D model when compared with terrestrial sampling methods. This technology is mostly used for ground-based surveys.Apart from aerial surveys, the LiDAR sensor is the most important component in self-driving cars. The LiDAR sensor provides continuous 360 degrees of visibility and accurate depth information.LiDAR was first used on a spacecraft during the Apollo 15 mission in 1971, when astronauts mapped the surface of the moon.The LiDAR here is essentially a Time-of-flight sensor as seen on devices like the Galaxy Note 10+, Galaxy S20 Ultra and Huawei Mate 30 Pro. But it appears that Apple has used a custom LiDAR scanner, which is slightly more advanced than a ToF system.Apple says the new LiDAR sensor can measure an object up to five meters (16 feet) away. In contrast, a ToF sensor on existing smartphones can only detect objects at a maximum distance of around two metres. Meanwhile, Apple claims its LiDAR system can operate ‚Äúat the photon level at nano-second speeds.‚ÄùApple believes its LIDAR scanner will immensely benefit Augmented Reality (AR) apps. For those of you who are not familiar, AR refers to a technology that overlays information and virtual objects on real-world scenes in real-time. It uses the existing environment and adds information to it to make a new artificial environment.Apple has been pushing the use of AR on the iPad and iPhone for quite some time. Apple‚Äôs App Store currently offers many AR apps, many of which are targeted at the student community.For developers though, the LiDAR sensor on the iPad Pro is useful to create future applications. The system takes advantage of ‚ÄúARKit,‚Äù a toolkit for developers to create powerful AR apps. We can expect Apple‚Äôs proprietary ‚ÄúMeasure‚Äù app and apps from third-party developers will try to take advantage of the LiDAR scanner on the new iPad Pro.There is no word on how the LiDAR sensor will improve photography on the iPad Pro.However, the LiDAR sensor also comes with certain disadvantages. LiDAR can measure the distance to surrounding objects up to 5 meters away, but won‚Äôt fare well in identifying objects in the vicinity. Also, it can‚Äôt perform well in fog, rain, snow and dusty weather. LiDAR also struggles to detect a glass wall or door, which is why smartphone manufacturers and self-driving cars makers use LiDAR along with secondary cameras and sensors. As in the case of the iPad Pro, Apple has added a 12MP wide and a 10MP ultrawide camera on the back, alongside the LiDAR sensor.Now that the iPad Pro comes with a LiDAR sensor, it‚Äôs likely that Apple will introduce the technology to the iPhone 12 which is scheduled for launch later this year. Recent reports suggest that Apple is working on a new AR app, codenamed ‚ÄúGobi‚Äù, which will allow users to preview products/items in a store before purchasing them. Apple is also rumoured to be working on a pair of AR glasses, though there is no fixed timeline of launch. The launch of the iPad Pro with a LiDAR sensor could be the beginning of something big.
